Link building is a human endeavor

   Since the beginning of SEO, link building has been about human
   connection. People like Eric Ward were building links on the web before
   search engines like Google existed. Ward and other link-building
   pioneers weren’t building links for SEO and search crawlers — they were
   building links for human readers and site owners, helping connect
   people to the information they sought.

   People rely on the internet in their day-to-day lives more now than
   they ever have before, and the web is fueled by links. Search engines
   may be able to track links and even analyze them to a degree, but links
   are first and foremost designed to serve people. It takes human minds
   to create links that are truly valuable to other humans.

   Link building is a human endeavor.

Google is devaluing spam and manipulation

   Link building is no longer about manipulation.

   Google has gotten much better at detecting manipulation and link
   spam — and is continuing to improve. Gone are the days of
   auto-generating thousands of shoddy links and spamming your way to the
   top of the search results.

   Thanks to the Penguin algorithm and the continued efforts of
   Google’s web spam team, link building has come full circle. Building
   links today is much more akin to the “good ol’ days” when people
   first started building links, rather than the Wild West-style antics of
   the pre-Penguin era.

   As Google continues to get better at identifying and devaluing link
   spam, link building as an industry is shifting back toward human value
   and interaction.

   If Penguin ever updates again, it is expected to move to a real-time
   model. This would mean another step forward for Google in the battle
   against spam, making real links earned through human interaction even
   more valuable.

Real links require human interaction

   The best way to acquire real links that search engines value is through
   human interaction. This means manual outreach to real people and site
   owners.

   I recently attended SearchFest in Portland and sat in on Jon Cooper’s
   session about link building. One of the first points Jon made was that
   bulk link building is dead, and that links should come from one-on-one
   outreach with a real person.

   Any site that lets you put a link up without any sort of human
   engagement or interaction probably isn’t a site you want a link on. You
   should be able to find a real human being who is clearly in charge of
   any site you target. Otherwise the site is likely abandoned, created
   purely for web spiders, or both.

   Identifying appropriate link prospects also requires a human eye.

   Relevance is the most important factor when considering a link
   prospect, and that can only be determined through human thought and
--

   Metrics measured by algorithms and machines (such as Domain Authority,
   Page Authority and Trust Flow) are important, but they only provide a
   piece of the full picture. It takes a human link builder to combine
   that information with other factors like relevance and audience
   engagement to assess the true value of a link prospect.

   Worthwhile links don’t happen without a real connection. If a link to
   your site isn’t going to benefit a site owner’s audience, then you
   won’t get a link — and you shouldn’t.

Links are for people, not spiders

   Eric Ward was building links before search engines were popular because
   links are meant for human users, not search crawlers.

   Links were useful and necessary long before Google existed. Google
   became the search giant it is today because it recognized the inherent
   value in links online and leveraged this value for their search
   algorithm.

   Links help people traverse the web. Without links, the internet would
   be an unnavigable mess of information, and search engines like Google
   couldn’t function. Consider a human-first approach when earning links,
   and think about how the links you build will help your audience find
   your site.

   Google will never devalue or penalize links that are built with a
   human-first approach, because they are foundational to the way its
   algorithm operates.

   Links are public endorsements. Of course, links signal authority to
   search engines, but they also signal trust and respect to human
   readers. If a site owner wants to endorse or recommend another site to
   their audience, they link to it. A link provides a direct pathway to
   the recommended site, and there is no simpler or better way to endorse
   another site online.

   Links also improve user experience, particularly for online content.
   Links can be used as citations or references to add depth to content.
   Rather than expanding on a large, complicated topic, links provide a
   way to deliver important information to your readers without having to
   distract from your main point.

   As a link builder, you should be promoting your resources to the
   appropriate sites because links help connect the web and improve the
   overall user experience.

Using a “human-first” approach for link building

   Understanding that link building is a human endeavor is one thing, but
   putting that philosophy into practice is another.

   Here are some general guidelines for using a human-first approach for
   link acquisition:
     * Focus on relevance: Explain to another person (colleague, friend or
       client) why a given link opportunity is relevant. If you can’t
       plainly state why it’s relevant, don’t pursue that link.
     * Operate with an audience-first mindset: When prospecting,
       prioritize sites your customers frequently visit over general
       authority metrics.
     * Consider context: Think about where your link might appear on a
       page and whether or not someone would click it. If so, would they
       be pleased with where it takes them?
     * Human outreach: Remember that there is a real (and likely busy)
       person on the other side of your outreach, and treat them as such.
       Always be polite and considerate.
     * Deliver value: Earn links that offer a “triple-win” for your site,
       the linking site and human readers that find them.
