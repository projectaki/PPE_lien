Physical exercise and dementia

   Of all the lifestyle changes that have been studied, taking regular
   physical exercise appears to be one of the best things that you can do
   to reduce your risk of getting dementia.

   Of all the lifestyle changes that have been studied, taking regular
   physical exercise appears to be one of the best things that you can do
   to reduce your risk of getting dementia.

   Several studies looking at the effect of aerobic exercise (exercise
   that increases your heart rate) in middle-aged or older adults have
   reported improvements in thinking and memory, and reduced rates of
   dementia.

Exercising in mid-life

   Prospective studies follow the health and behaviour of a group of
   people over time. Several prospective studies have looked at
   middle-aged people and the effects of physical exercise on their
   thinking and memory in later life. Combining the results of 11 studies
   shows that regular exercise can significantly reduce the risk of
   developing dementia by about 30 per cent. For Alzheimer's disease
   specifically, the risk was reduced by 45 per cent.

   One particular study looked at health behaviours of over 2,000 men in
   Wales, and followed them for 35 years. Of the five behaviours that were
   assessed (regular exercise, not smoking, moderate alcohol intake,
   healthy body weight and healthy diet), exercise had the greatest effect
   in terms of reducing dementia risk. Overall, people who followed four
   or five of the above behaviours were up to 60 per cent less likely to
   develop dementia.

   In the short term, aerobic exercise can also improve the performance of
   healthy adults on thinking tests. Pulling together the results of 29
   clinical trials, a month or more of regular aerobic exercise resulted
   in improvements in memory, attention and processing speed when compared
   with regular non-aerobic exercise such as stretching and toning.

Exercising in later life

   Although less research has been done with healthy older people, there
   is some evidence to show older people can also reduce their risk of
   dementia with regular exercise. In a study of 716 people with an
   average age of 82 years, people who were in the bottom 10 per cent in
   terms of amount of daily physical activity were more than twice as
   likely to develop Alzheimer's disease as those in the top 10 per cent.

   A literature review found 27 studies looking at the effect of physical
   activity on brain function in people over 60 years of age. In 26 of the
   studies there was a clear link between physical activity levels and
   cognitive performance, suggesting that exercise might be an effective
   way to reduce cognitive decline in later life.

   Aerobic exercise has also been shown to affect the brains of healthy
   older people. In a modest-sized controlled trial, one year of aerobic
   exercise resulted in a small increase in the size of the hippocampus
   (the key brain area involved in memory), which was the equivalent of
   reversing one to two years of age-related shrinkage. A study of 638
   people in Scotland that asked people about their activity levels found
   those who were physically active at age 70 experienced less brain
   shrinkage over three years than those who were not.

What does 'physical activity' mean?

   The research studies in this area do not all use the same definition of
   'physical activity' or exercise. In general they are referring to
   aerobic exercise performed for a sustained period of time, perhaps
   20–30 minutes. Most of the studies report on the effects of aerobic
   exercise done several times a week and maintained for at least a year.

   However, physical exercise does not just mean playing a sport or
   running. It can also mean a daily activity such as brisk walking,
   cleaning or gardening. One study found that the risk of Alzheimer's
   disease can be reduced by daily physical tasks such as cooking and
   washing up.

Areas of uncertainty

   Usually, we would like there to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
   that show how one factor can influence another. To date, no RCT has
   shown an exercise regime can prevent dementia, although there are
   several in progress across Europe.

   We need more research to understand the level and intensity of exercise
   that is most effective; this is also likely to vary throughout
   someone's life. We also need more research to understand the role that
   physical activity plays in reducing the risk of different types of
   dementia.

   Physical activity and exercise for people with dementia

   Leading a physically active lifestyle can have a significant impact on
   the wellbeing of people with dementia.

Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

   Note

   Make sure you have sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel in your extensions in
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom textHeading Text` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different sectionCross-References to Locations in
the Same Document`.

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:

Overview
**********

RST Overview content


.. _Sphinx Overview:

Overview
*********

Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text link URL`_

   For example:
`CNN http://cnn.com`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

import glob
modules = glob.glob(dirname(__file__)+"/*.py")

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

    4. In the project conf.py file, add the following lines:
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \
  echo "The link name is: " $$link_name; \
  echo "The link text is: " $$link_text; \
  echo "The URL is: " $$link_url; \
  echo "Creating the file: " $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py"; \
  echo "Enter the link in content as :xref:\`"$$link_name"\`"; \
  echo "The user will see:" $$link_text; \
  echo "Make sure you build and test the link."; \
  echo "import link\n\nen_us_user_text = \"$$link_text\" \n\n\
links.xref_links.update({\"$$link_name\": (en_us_user_text, \"$$link_url\")})" \
   $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py" \

   You can then create a link using the make link command from any
   project. You are prompted to enter the:
     * Link key
     * Link text
     * URL
     * Python file name

   You could also add a Sublime snippet for new links.

Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
LINKCHECKDIR  = build/linkcheck

.PHONY: checklinks
  checklinks:
  $(SPHINXBUILD) -b linkcheck $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) $(LINKCHECKDIR)
  @echo
  @echo "Check finished. Report is in $(LINKCHECKDIR)."

   Then, from the command window, enter:
make checklinks

   Sphinx compiles the document and tests all links. It shows the results
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.
   Link test results.

   AIM 

Internet Links

   In this topic, we continue our discussion of features found under the
   Misc command on the Tools Menu.

   The Internet Links menu command displays the Internet links for the
   person that is logged on to AIM. By clicking a link, the default Web
   browser, Internet Explorer or Firefox for example, will connect to the
   link via the Internet.

   In the steps that follow, we show you how to add and remove folders and
   links. With a little practice, you will be able to use the AIM Internet
   Links to quickly connect to your business related Internet links.
    1. On the Tools menu, point to Misc, and then click Internet Links.

    2. In the unlabeled box, you can type a Web address (URL) and then
       click the Go To button to open the URL in your default Web browser.
    3. In the list of Internet links, click or to expand and collapse
       folders containing Internet links.
    4. Double-click a link to open the link in your Web browser.
       Alternatively, you can single-click the link and the link will be
       displayed in the unlabeled text box so you can view it or click the
       Go To button.

    5. To modify the links and folders shown in the list, right-click in
       the list and choose from the available options.
         1. Update Link – save changes to the link properties entered in
            the unlabeled text box
         2. Add Folder – add a sub-folder to an existing folder by

   Method of referencing visual computer data
   For help creating links on Wikipedia, see Help:Contents/Links.
   [250px-Hyperlink-Wikipedia.svg.png] An example of a hyperlink as
   commonly seen in a web browser, with a mouse pointer hovering above
   it[220px-Sistema_hipertextual.jpg] Visual abstraction of several
   documents being connected by hyperlinks

   In computing, a hyperlink, or simply a link, is a digital reference to
   data that the user can follow or be guided to by clicking or
   tapping.^[1] A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific
   element within a document. Hypertext is text with hyperlinks. The text
   that is linked from is known as anchor text. A software system that is
   used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system, and to
   create a hyperlink is to hyperlink (or simply to link). A user
   following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext.

   The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document.
   For example, in content from Wikipedia or Google Search, many words and
   terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms.
   Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference mechanisms such as
   tables of contents, footnotes, bibliographies, indexes, letters, and
   glossaries.

   In some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be
   followed in two directions, so both ends act as anchors and as targets.
   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World
   Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the
   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]
   Another possibility is transclusion, for which the link target is a
   document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source
   document. Not only persons browsing the document may follow hyperlinks.
   These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A
   program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and
   gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web spider or
   crawler.

Links

Inline links

   An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding
   the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the
   user following the link.

   An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for
   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing
   software – e.g., with an external link. This allows for smaller file
   sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is
   not needed, as is the case when rearranging a page layout.

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element anchor id="name" /"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of
   implementing it. In word processor apps, anchors can be inserted where
   desired and may be called bookmarks. In URLs, the hash character (#)
   precedes the name of the anchor for the fragment.

   One way to define a hot area in an image is by a list of coordinates
   that indicate its boundaries. For example, a political map of Africa
   may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that
   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive
   embedding of links in the various skin elements.

   Text hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a word or a phrase and makes
   this text clickable.

   Image hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into an image and makes this
   image clickable.

   Bookmark hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a text or an image and
   takes visitors to another part of a web page.

   E-mail hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into e-mail address and allows
   visitors to send an e-mail message to this e-mail address.^[4]

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

Uses in various technologies

HTML

   Main article: HTML element § Anchor

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.

   This is what a hyperlink to the home page of the W3C organization could
   look like in HTML code:
a href="https://www.w3.org/"W3C organization website/a

   This HTML code consists of several tags:
     * The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag a, and includes a
       hyperlink reference href="https://www.w3.org/" to the URL for the
       page. (The URL is enclosed in quotes.)
     * The URL is followed by , marking the end of the anchor opening
       tag.
     * The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the
       only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when
       the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link,
       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.
     * Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue
       for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link
       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (/a) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the
       "rel" attribute which specifies the relationship between the
       current document and linked document.

   Webgraph is a graph, formed from web pages as vertices and hyperlinks,
   as directed edges.

Remove XLink: hyperlinks

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.

Wikis

   While wikis may use HTML-type hyperlinks, the use of wiki markup, a set
   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
   original wiki software, the WikiWikiWeb used CamelCase for this
   purpose. CamelCase was also used in the early version of Wikipedia and
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.

Virtual worlds

   Main article: Hyperlinks in virtual worlds

   Hyperlinks are being implemented in various 3D virtual world networks,
   including those that use the OpenSimulator^[8] and Open Cobalt^[9]
   platforms.

Permalinks

   Main article: Digital preservation

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is
   of some months.^[12]

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
   This can refer to a document, e.g. a webpage, or other resource, or to
   a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an HTML
   element with a "name" or "id" attribute at that position of the HTML
   document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a
   fragment identifier – "#id attribute" – appended.

   When linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the "id attribute" can
   be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another
   element of the PDF, for example, "#page=386".

Link behavior in web browsers

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
   attributes "title", "target", and "class" or "id":

          a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class"link label/a

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          a href="https://example.com/"Example/a

   In a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word
   "Example" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the
   example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

   Creation of new windows is probably the most common use of the "target"
   attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window
   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no
   endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked
   from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes
   cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.

   Another special page name is "_top", which causes any frames in the
   current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the
   full window.

History

   [220px-SRI_ARC_Engelbart_Nov_1969.jpg] Douglas Engelbart and his team
   at SRI, 1969

   The term "link" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by Ted Nelson at
   the start of Project Xanadu. Nelson had been inspired by "As We May
   Think", a popular 1945 essay by Vannevar Bush. In the essay, Bush
   described a microfilm-based machine (the Memex) in which one could link
   any two pages of information into a "trail" of related information, and
   then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a
   single microfilm reel.

   In a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980,
   Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into
   the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings
   rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine
   to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated
   the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was
   eventually funded by Autodesk in the 1980s, it never created this
   proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a
   team led by Douglas Engelbart (with Jeff Rulifson as chief programmer)
   was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a
   single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between
   paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with NLS. Ben Shneiderman
   working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the
   highlighted link in the HyperTIES system in 1983. HyperTIES was used to
   produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988
   Communications of the ACM, which was cited as the source for the link
   concept in Tim Berners-Lee's Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web. In
   1988, Ben Shneiderman and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish
   "Hypertext Hands-On!", the world's first electronic book.^[citation
   needed]

   Released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh, the database program
   HyperCard allowed for hyperlinking between various pages within a
   document, as well as to other documents and separate applications on
   the same computer.^[14] In 1990, Windows Help, which was introduced
   with Microsoft Windows 3.0, had widespread use of hyperlinks to link
   different pages in a single help file together; in addition, it had a
   visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message
   to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced
   on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included
   hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the
   Gopher protocol from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993
   release of the Mosaic browser (which could handle Gopher links as well
   as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text,
   and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and
   hyperlinks.

Legal issues

   Main article: Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing

   While hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the web,
   some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have
   claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.

   Contentious in particular are deep links, which do not point to a
   site's home page or other entry point designated by the site owner, but
   to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own
   designated flow, and inline links, which incorporate the content in
   question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the
   linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is
   added.^[15]

   In certain jurisdictions, it is or has been held that hyperlinks are
   not merely references or citations, but are devices for copying web
   pages. In the Netherlands, Karin Spaink was initially convicted in this
   way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was
   overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere
   publication of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an
   illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal
   material is illegal. In 2004, Josephine Ho was acquitted of 'hyperlinks
   that corrupt traditional values' in Taiwan.^[16]

   In 2000, British Telecom sued Prodigy, claiming that Prodigy infringed
   its patent (U.S. Patent 4,873,662) on web hyperlinks. After litigation,
   a court found for Prodigy, ruling that British Telecom's patent did not
   cover web hyperlinks.^[17]

   In United States jurisprudence, there is a distinction between the mere
   act of linking to someone else's website, and linking to content that
   is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or infringing (e.g.,
   illegal MP3 copies).^[18] Several courts have found that merely linking
   to someone else's website, even if by bypassing commercial advertising,
   is not copyright or trademark infringement, regardless of how much
   someone else might object.^[19]^[20]^[21] Linking to illegal or
   infringing content can be sufficiently problematic to give rise to
   legal liability.^[22]^[23]^[24] Compare^[25] for a summary of the
   current status of US copyright law as to hyperlinking, see the
   discussion regarding the Arriba Soft and Perfect 10 cases.

   Somewhat controversially, Vuestar Technologies has tried to enforce
   patents applied for by its owner, Ronald Neville Langford,^[26] around
   the world relating to search techniques using hyperlinked images to
   other websites or web pages.^[27]

Lesson 2: Understanding Hyperlinks

   /en/internet-tips/getting-started-with-the-internet/content/

Understanding hyperlinks

   Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit
   different? Whenever you see a word or phrase thatʼs underlined in blue,
   itʼs probably a hyperlink, or link for short. You might already know
   how links work, even if youʼve never thought about them much before.
   For example, try clicking the link below.

   Hey, Iʼm a link! Click me!

   Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will take
   you to a different webpage. In the example below, weʼre clicking a link
   to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
   using links to navigate Wikipedia.org

   When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site
   appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most
   web browsers show the linkʼs URL in the bottom-left
   corner of the window.
   viewing the link preview

   You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever
   you hover over a link.
   viewing the cursor as a hand icon

   If you see this icon, it means youʼve found a link. Youʼll find other
   types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use
   images as links, so you can just click the image to navigate to another
   page. In the example below, weʼre clicking the picture of a coffee mug
   to open a page with more information about it.
   clicking an image formatted as a link

   Links donʼt always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you
   to download a file. When you click a link like this, the file will be
   downloaded to your computer. In the example below, weʼre downloading an
   installation file for a new application.
   downloading a file from a link

   As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They
   allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and
   do a whole lot more.

   Objective ECM 

Creating an internet link

   You can add internet links to containers in Objective ECM. For example,
   during research on a team project you may have come across valuable
   information within a number of websites. You can add these website
   links to your team's folder.

   Internet links can be one of the following protocols:
     * http
     * https
     * mailto
     * ftp
     * a custom protocol.

   How to add an internet link Closed
    1. Find or go to the location where you wish to create the internet
       link.
    2. Select the Action button, then Create object .
       The Choose a type to create blade displays to the right of the
       Content pane.
    3. Select Internet link.
    4. Enter a Name for the internet link.
    5. If you would like to create the internet link in a different
       container other than your Handy folder, select magnify or choose a
       recently used Container from the drop-down list
       On the Change container dialog box, there are a number of browse
       options for you to choose from to select a different container:
          + On the Recent tab, select a container from the list of ones
            you have recently accessed, then Use selected.
          + On the Handy tab, use the Navigation pane to browse your
            Handy, select a container, then Use selected.
          + On the Home tab, use the Navigation pane to browse your
            Objective Home folder to find and select the container you
            want. Then choose Use selected.
            Object aliases will not be displayed on the Home tab.
          + On the Global tab, use the Navigation pane to browse your
            Objective Global folder to find and select the container you
            want. Then choose Use selected.
          + On the Find tab, select the object type from the drop-down and
            enter your search criteria in the adjacent textbox. Select
            Find to display the search results. If you have multiple
            containers with the same name, you can select the Down arrow
            to view the container's hierarchy.
            Choose a container from the results list, then Use selected.
            You can also select a container in the search results and
            navigate to it, where you can select it's sub-folders or any
            other folder.
            The Selected field of the Change container dialog box lists
            your chosen container.
       Or you can simply drag-and-drop another container from your Content
       pane into the Selected container section of the Create folder
       blade.
       An error message displays if the selected container is not
       appropriate or you don’t have the appropriate permissions to use
       it.

    6. Select an object sub-Type from the drop-down list.
       By default the type is internet link.
    7. Enter or copy and paste the URL for the internet link.
    8. Optionally enter a Description for the internet link you are
       creating.

    9. Expand the Security settings section:
         1. Select a Security Classification from the drop-down list.
            You can only select options in the Security settings section
            if you have permission to do so and the section is visible.
            Security classifications can be used to configure the
            available access levels to stored data. Each user also has a
            Highest Available Classification assigned to them, which
            allows them to view objects of certain security
            classifications. This means that when you have set an object's
            security classification, any user with a Highest Available
            Classification equal to or higher than that object's security
            classification, is able to see it.
            Tick the Use inherited classification checkbox to use the
            listed classifications that are already part of the target /
            parent container.
         2. Select Caveats from the drop-down lists.
            Caveats are used in your organisation to secure information
            relating to an area of practice or specific knowledge level.
            If your administrator has set up caveats to be visible to all
            users, you will be able to assign caveats to objects that have
            been assigned to you or a specific caveat group. You must also
            have the appropriate user privileges to assign 'inactive'
            caveats (those that are no longer in use) where necessary.
            You can Find a caveat by entering the Name of the caveat then
            selecting Find. Choose the appropriate caveat from the search
            results, then Use selected.
            Tick the Use inherited caveats checkbox to use the listed
            caveats that are already part of the target / parent
            container.
   10. Expand Add fields to select a catalogue from the drop-down list.
       Depending on the catalogue selected, you may have other choices to
       make.
       Keyword fields
       For some object types, you will need to choose the appropriate
       keyword library to use. Your organisation may have created a custom
       keyword thesaurus to enable the classification and retrieval of
       records. Assigning keywords to an object will enable faster
       retrieval in searches and queries.
       All objects in Objective ECM (except for keywords) can use
       keywords.
       Keywords are grouped in the list by keyword library.
          + Select the appropriate keyword library from the User Catalogue
            drop-down list.
          + Either, select a keyword from the list or Find a keyword.
            Enter your keyword search criteria in the Name field. If you
            do not select Show non-preferred, only frequently used terms
            will be displayed in the search results.
       Select the appropriate keyword usage from the search results.
       Note:   In Objective Navigator, your Objective administrator must
       have already added keywords to the keyword library and defined them
       as being able to be assigned to objects, before you can include
       them with your objects.
       Fields from other applications
       If your catalogue fields are mapped to another application, you can
       search and select field values from that application. For more
       information, see Searching and selecting catalogue field values
       from third-party applications.
   11. Enter information into the other fields as appropriate.
   12. Select Create.
       Tip:  Select Back at any time to create a different object type if
       needed.

<text>                   1.5 Access Networks and Physical Media

   In sections 1.3 and 1.4 we have examined the roles of end systems and
   routers in a network architecture.  In this section we consider the
   access network - the physical link(s) that connect an end system to its
   edge router, i.e., the first router on a path from the end system to
   any other distant end system..  Since access network technology is
   closely tied to physical media technology (fiber, coaxial pair, twisted
   pair telephone wire, radio spectrum), we consider these two topics
   together in this section.

                             1.5.1 Access Networks

    Figure 1.5-1 shows the access networks' links highlighted in red.

                                [acc_phy.GIF]
                        Figure 1.5-1: Access networks

   Access networks can be loosely divided into three categories:
     * residential access networks, connecting a home end system into the
       network;
     * institutional access networks, connecting an end system in a
       business or educational institution into the network;
     * mobile access networks, connecting a mobile end system into the
       network

   These categories are not hard and fast; some corporate end systems may
   well use the access network technology that we ascribe to residential
   access networks, and vice versa.   Our descriptions below are meant to
   hold for the common (if not every) case.

  Residential Access Networks

   A residential access network connects a home end system (typically a
   PC, but perhaps a Web TV or other residential system) to an edge
   router. Probably the most common form of home access is using a modem
   over a POTS (plain old telephone system) dialup line to an Internet
   service provider (ISP). The home modem converts the digital output of
   the PC into analog format  for transmission over the analog phone
   line.  A modem in the ISP converts the analog signal back into digital
   form for input to the ISP router.  In this case, the "access network"
   is simply a point-to-point dialup link into an edge router.  The
   point-to-point link is your ordinary twisted-pair phone line. (We will
   discuss twisted pair later in this section.) Today's modem speeds allow
   dialup access at rates up to 56 Kbps.  However, due to the poor quality
   of twisted-pair line between many homes and ISPs, many users get an
   effective rate significantly less than 56 Kbps.  For an in depth
   discussion of the practical aspects of modems see the Institute for
   Global Communications (IGC) web page on Modems and Data Communications.

   While dialup modems require conversion of the end system's digital data
   into analog form for transmission, so-called narrowband ISDN technology
   (Integrated Services Digital Network) [Pacific Bell 1998] allows for
   all-digital transmission of data from a home end system over ISDN
   "telephone" lines to a phone company central office.  Although ISDN was
   originally conceived as a way to carry digital data from one end of the
   phone system to another, it is also an important network access
   technology that  provides higher speed access (e.g., 128 Kbps)  from
   the home into a data network such as the Internet.  In this case, ISDN
   can be thought of simply as a "better modem" [NAS 1995].  A good source
   for additional WWW information on ISDN is Dan Kegel's ISDN page.

   Dialup modems and narrowband ISDN are already widely deployed
   technologies. Two new technologies, Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
   (ADSL) [ADSL 1998] and hybrid fiber coaxial cable (HFC) [Cable 1998]
   are currently being deployed.  ADSL is conceptually similar to dialup
   modems: it is a new modem technology again running over existing
   twisted pair telephone lines, but can transmit at rates of up to about
   8 Mbps from the ISP router to a home end system.  The data rate in the
   reverse direction, from the home end system to the central office
   router, is less than 1 Mbps.  The asymmetry in the access speeds gives
   rise to the term "Asymmetric" in ADSL.  The asymmetry in the data rates
   reflects the belief that home users are more likely to be a consumer of
   information (bringing data into their homes) than a producer of
   information.

   ADSL uses frequency division multiplexing, as described in the previous
   section. In particular, ADSL divides the communication link between the
   home the ISP into three non-overlapping frequency bands:

     * a high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 KHz to 1 MHz band;
     * a medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 KHz to 50 KHz band;
     * and an ordinary POTs two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 KHz
       band.

   One of the features of ADSL is that the service allows the user to make
   an ordinary telephone call, using the POTs channel, while
   simultaneously surfing the Web. This feature is not available with
   standard dailup modems. The actually amount of downstream and upstream
   bandwidth available to the user is a function of the distance between
   the home modem and the ISP modem, the gauge of the twisted pair line,
   and the degree of electrical interference. For a high-quality line with
   negligible electrical interference, an 8 Mbps downstream transmission
   rate is possible if the distance between the home and the ISP is less
   than 3,000 meters; the downstream transmission rate drops to about 2
   Mbps for a distance of 6,000 meters. The upstream rate ranges from 16
   Kbps to 1 Mbps.

   While ADSL, ISDN and dailup modems all use ordinary phone lines, HFC
   access networks are extensions of the current cable network used for
   broadcasting cable television.  In a traditional cable system, a cable
   head end station broadcasts through a distribution of coaxial cable and
   amplifiers to residences. (We discuss coaxial cable later in this
   chapter.)  As illustrated in Figure 1.5-2,  fiber optics (also to be
   discussed soon) connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level
   junctions, from which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach
   individual houses and apartments. Each neighborhood juncture typically
   supports 500 to 5000 homes.

                                 [cable.jpg]
              Figure 1.5-2: A hybrid fiber-coax access network

   As with ADSL, HFC requires special modems, called cable modems.
   Companies that provide cable Internet access require their customers to
   either purchase or lease a modem. One such company is CyberCable, which
   uses Motorola's CyberSurfer Cable Modem and provides high-speed
   Internet access to most of the neighborhoods in Paris. Typically, the
   cable modem is an external device and connects to the home PC through a
   10-BaseT Ethernet port. (We will discuss Ethernet in great detail in
   Chapter 5.)  Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a
   downstream and an upstream channel. As with ADSL, the downstream
   channel is typically allocated more bandwidth and hence a larger
   transmission rate. For example, the downstream rate of the CyberCable
   system is 10 Mbps and the upstream rate is 768 Kbps. However, with HFC
   (and not with ADSL), these rates are shared among the homes, as we
   discuss below.

   One important characteristic of the HFC is that it is a shared
   broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the headend
   travels downstream on every link to every home; and every packet sent
   by a home travels on the upstream channel to the headend. For this
   reason, if several users are receiving different Internet videos on the
   downstream channel, actual rate at which each user receives its video
   will be significantly less than downstream rate. On the other hand, if
   all the active users are Web surfing, then each of the users may
   actually receive Web pages at the full downstream rate, as a small
   collection of users will rarely receive a Web page at exactly the same
   time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, packets sent by two
   different homes at the same time will collide, which further decreases
   the effective upstream bandwidth. (We will discuss this collision issue
   in some detail when we discuss Ethernet in Chapter 5.) Advocates of
   ADSL are quick to point out that ADSL is a point-to-point connection
   between the home and ISP, and therefore all the ADSL bandwidth is
   dedicated rather than shared. Cable advocates, however, argue that a
   reasonably dimensioned HFC network provides higher bandwidths than ADSL
   [@Home 1998].  The battle between ADSL and HFC for high speed
   residential access has clearly begun, e.g., [@Home 1998].

  Enterprise Access Networks

    In enterprise access networks, a local area network (LAN) is used to
   connect an end system to an edge router.   As we will see in Chapter 5,
   there are many different types of LAN technology.  However,  Ethernet
   technology is currently by far the most prevalent access technology in
   enterprise networks. Ethernet operates 10 Mbps or 100Mbps (and now even
   at 1 Gbps). It uses either twisted-pair copper wire are coaxial cable
   to connect  a number of end systems with each other and with an edge
   router.  The edge router is responsible for routing packets that have
   destinations outside of that LAN.  Like HFC, Ethernet uses a shared
   medium, so that end users share the the transmission rate of the LAN.
   More recently, shared Ethernet technology has been migrating towards
   switched Ethernet technology.  Switched Ethernet uses multiple coaxial
   cable or twisted pair Ethernet segments connected at a "switch"  to
   allow the full bandwidth an Ethernet to be delivered to different users
   on the same LAN simultaneously [Cisco 1998]. We will explore shared and
   switched Ethernet in some detail in Chapter 5.


  Mobile Access Networks

   Mobile access networks use the radio spectrum to connect a mobile end
   system (e.g., a laptop PC or a PDA with a wireless modem) to a base
   station, as shown in Figure 1.5-1.  This base station, in turn, is
   connected to an edge router of a data network.

   An emerging standard for wireless data networking is Cellular Digital
   Packet Data (CDPD) [Wireless 1998].  As the name suggests, a CDPD
   network operates as an overlay network (i.e., as a separate, smaller
   "virtual" network, as a piece of the larger network) within the
   cellular telephone network.  A CDPD network thus uses the same radio
   spectrum as the cellular phone system, and operates at speeds in the
   10's of Kbits per second.  As with cable-based access networks and
   shared Ethernet, CDPD end systems must share the transmission media
   with other CDPD end systems within the cell covered by a base station.
   A media access control (MAC) protocol is used to arbitrate channel
   sharing among the CDPD end systems; we will cover MAC protocols in
   detail in Chapter 5.

   The CDPD system supports the IP protocol, and thus allows an IP end
   system to exchange IP packets over the wireless channel with an IP base
   station.  A CDPD network can actually support multiple network layer
   protocols; in addition to IP, the ISO CNLP protocol is also supported.
   CDPD does not provide for any protocols above the network layer.  From
   an Internet perspective, CDPD can be viewed as extending the Internet
   dialtone (i.e., the ability to transfer IP packets) across a wireless
   link between a mobile end system and an Internet router. An excellent
   introduction to CDPD is [Waung 98].

  1.5.2 Physical Media

   In the previous subsection we gave an overview of some of the most
   important access network technologies in the Internet. While describing
   these technologies, we also indicated the physical media used. For
   example, we said that HFC uses a combination of fiber cable and coaxial
   cable. We said that ordinary modems, ISDN, and ADSL use twisted-pair
   copper wire. And we said that  mobile access network use the radio
   spectrum. In this subsection we provide a brief overview of these and
   other transmission media that are commonly employed in the Internet.

   In order to define what is meant by a "physical medium,", let us
   reflect on the brief life of a bit. Consider a bit traveling from one
   end system, through a series of links and routers, to another end
   system. This poor bit gets transmitted many, many times! The source
   end-system first transmits the bit and shortly thereafter the first
   router in the series receives the bit; the first router then transmits
   the bit and shortly afterwards the second router receives the bit, etc.
   Thus our bit, when traveling from source to destination, passes through
   a series of transmitter-receiver pairs. For each transmitter-receiver
   pair, the bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves across a
   physical medium. The physical medium can take many shapes and forms,
   and does not have to be of the same type for each transmitter-receiver
   pair along the path. Examples of physical media include twisted-pair
   copper wire, coaxial cable, multimode fiber optic cable, terrestrial
   radio spectrum and satellite radio spectrum. Physical media fall into
   two categories: guided media and unguided media. With guided media, the
   waves are guided along a solid medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, a
   twisted-pair cooper wire or a coaxial cable. With unguided media, the
   waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space, such as in a
   digital satellite channel or in a CDPD system.

  Some Popular Physical Media

   Suppose you want to wire a building to allow computers to access the
   Internet or an intranet -- should you use twisted-pair copper wire,
   coaxial cable, or fiber optics? Which of these media gives the highest
   bit rates over the longest distances? We shall address these questions
   below.

   But before we get into the characteristics of the various guided medium
   types, let us say a few words about their costs. The actual cost of the
   physical link (copper wire, fiber optic cable, etc.) is often
   relatively minor compared with the other networking costs. In
   particular, the labor cost associated with the installation of the
   physical link can be orders of magnitude higher than the cost of the
   material. For this reason, many builders install twisted pair, optical
   fiber, and coaxial cable to every room in a building. Even if only one
   medium is initially used, there is a good chance that another medium
   could be used in the near future, and so money is saved but not having
   to lay additional wires.

   Twisted-Pair Copper Wire

   The least-expensive and most commonly-used transmission medium is
   twisted-pair copper wire. For over one-hundred years it has been used
   by telephone networks. In fact, more than 99% of the wired connections
   from the telephone handset to the local telephone switch use
   twisted-pair copper wire. Most of us have seen twisted pair in our
   homes and work environments. Twisted pair consists of two insulated
   copper wires, each about 1 mm thick, arranged in a regular spiral
   pattern; see Figure 1.5-3.  The wires are twisted together to reduce
   the electrical interference from similar pairs close by.  Typically, a
   number of pairs are bundled together in a cable by wrapping the pairs
   in a protective shield. A wire pair constitutes a single communication
   link.

                               [grentwist.gif]
                         Figure 1.5-3: Twisted Pair

   Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is commonly used for computer networks
   within a building, that is, for local area networks (LANs). Data rates
   for LANs using twisted pair today range from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps. The
   data rates that can be achieved depend on the thickness of the wire and
   the distance between transmitter and receiver. Two types of UTP are
   common in LANs: category 3 and category 5. Category 3 corresponds to
   voice-grade twisted pair, commonly found in office buildings. Office
   buildings are often prewired with two or more parallel pairs of
   category 3 twisted pair; one pair is used for telephone communication,
   and the additional pairs can be used for additional telephone lines or
   for LAN networking. 10 Mbps Ethernet, one of the most prevalent LAN
   types, can use category 3 UTP. Category 5, with its more twists per
   centimeter and Teflon insulation, can handle higher bit rates. 100 Mbps
   Ethernet running on category 5 UTP has become very popular  in recent
   years. In recent years, category 5 UTP has become common for
   preinstallation in new office buildings.

   When fiber-optic technology emerged in the 1980s, many people
   disparaged twisted-pair  because of its relatively low bit rates. Some
   people even felt that fiber optic technology would completely replace
   twisted pair. But twisted pair did not give up so easily. Modern
   twisted-pair technology, such as category 5 UTP, can achieve data rates
   of 100 Mbps for distances up to a few hundred meters. Even higher rates
   are possible over shorter distances. In the end, twisted-pair has
   emerged as the dominant  solution for high-speed LAN networking.

   As discussed in Section 1.5.1, twisted-pair is also commonly used for
   residential Internet access. We saw that dial-up modem technology
   enables access at rates of up to 56 Kbps over twisted pair. We also saw
   that ISDN is available in many communities, providing access rates of
   about 128 Kbps over twisted pair. We also saw that ADSL (Asymmetric
   Digital Subscriber Loop) technology has enabled residential users to
   access the Web at rates in excess of 6 Mbps over twisted pair.

   Coaxial-Cable

   Like twisted pair, coaxial cable consists of two copper conductors, but
   the two conductors are concentric rather than parallel. With this
   construction and a special insulation and shielding, coaxial cable can
   have higher bit rates than twisted pair. Coaxial cable comes in two
   varieties: baseband coaxial cable and broadband coaxial cable.

   Baseband coaxial cable, also called 50-ohm cable, is about a centimeter
   thick, lightweight, and easy to bend. It is  commonly used in LANs; in
   fact, the computer you use at work or at school is probably connected
   to a LAN with either baseband coaxial cable or with UTP. Take a look at
   the the connection to your computer's interface card. If you see a
   telephone-like jack and some wire that resembles telephone wire, you
   are using UTP; if you see a T-connector and a cable running out of both
   sides of the T-connector, you are using baseband coaxial cable. The
   terminology "baseband" comes from the fact that the stream of bits is
   dumped directly into the cable, without shifting the signal to a
   different frequency band. 10 Mbps Ethernets can use either UTP or
   baseband coaxial cable. As we will discuss in the Chapter 5, it is a
   little more expensive to use UTP for 10 Mbps Ethernet, as UTP requires
   an additional networking device, called a hub.

   Broadband coaxial cable, also called 75-ohm cable, is quite a bit
   thicker, heavier, and stiffer than the baseband variety. It was once
   commonly used in LANs and can still be found in some older
   installations. For LANs, baseband cable is now preferable, since it is
   less expensive, easier to physically handle, and does not require
   attachment cables. Broadband cable, however, is quite common in cable
   television systems. As we saw in Section 1.5.1, cable television
   systems have been recently been coupled with cable modems to provide
   residential users with Web access at rates of 10 Mbps or higher. With
   broadband coaxial cable, the transmitter shifts the digital signal to a
   specific frequency band, and the resulting analog signal is sent from
   the transmitter to one or more receivers. Both baseband and broadband
   coaxial cable can be used as a guided shared medium. Specifically, a
   number of end systems can be connected directly to the cable, and all
   the end systems receive whatever any one of the computers transmits. We
   will look at this issue in more detail in Chapter 5.

   Fiber Optics

   An optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of
   light, with each pulse representing a bit. A single optical fiber can
   support tremendous bit rates, up to tens or even hundreds of gigabits
   per second. They are immune to electromagnetic interference, have very
   low signal attenuation up to 100 kilometers, and are very hard to tap.
   These characteristics have made fiber optics the preferred long-haul
   guided transmission media, particularly for overseas links. Many of the
   long-distance telephone networks in the United States and elsewhere now
   use fiber optics exclusively. Fiber optics is also prevalent in the
   backbone of the Internet. However, the high cost of optical devices --
   such as transmitters, receivers, and switches -- has hindered their
   deployment for short-haul transport, such as in a LAN or into the home
   in a residential access network. ATT Labs provides an excellent site
   on fiber optics, including several nice animations.

   Terrestrial and Satellite Radio Channels

   Radio channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum.  They are
   an attractive media because require no physical "wire" to be installed,
   can penetrate walls, provide connectivity to a mobile user, and can
   potentially carry a signal for long distances. The characteristics a
   radio channel depend significantly on the propagation environment and
   the distance over which a signal is to be carried. Environmental
   considerations determine path loss and shadow fading (which decrease in
   signal strength as it travels over a distance and around/through
   obstructing objects), multipath fading (due to signal reflection off of
   interfering objects),  and interference (due to other radio channels or
   electromagnetic signals).

   Terrestrial radio channels can be broadly classified into two groups:
   those that operate as local area networks (typically spanning 10's to a
   few hundred meters) and wide-area radio channels that are used for
   mobile data services (typically operating within a metropolitan
   region).  A number of wireless LAN products are on the market,
   operating in the 1 to 10's of Mbps range. Mobile data services (such as
   the CDPD standard we touched on in section 1.3), typically provide
   channels that operate at 10's of Kbps.  See  [Goodman 97] for a survey
   and discussion of the technology and products.

   A communication satellite links two or more earth-based microwave
   transmitter/receivers, known as ground stations. The satellite receives
   transmissions on one frequency band, regenerates the signal using a
   repeater (discussed below), and transmits the signal on another
   frequency. Satellites can provide bandwidths in the gigabit per second
   range. Two types of satellites are used in communications:
   geostationary satellites and low-altitude satellites.

   Geostationary satellites permanently remain above the same spot on the
   Earth. This stationary presence is achieved by placing the satellite in
   orbit at 36,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface. This huge
   distance between from ground station though satellite back to ground
   station introduces a substantial signal propagation delay of 250
   milliseconds. Nevertheless, satellites links are often used in
   telephone networks and in the backbone of the Internet.

   Low-altitude satellites are placed much closer to the Earth and do not
   remain permanently above one spot on the Earth. They rotate around the
   Earth just as the Moon rotates around the Earth. To provide continuous
   coverage to an area, many satellites to be placed in orbit. There are
   currently many low-altitude communication systems in development. The
   Iridium system, for example, consists of 66 low-altitude satellites.
   Lloyd's satellite constellations provides and collects information on
   Iridium as well as other satellite constellation systems. The
   low-altitude satellite technology may be used for Internet access
   sometime in the future.

Data link layer, Ethernet and physical layer

Overview

   In the previous chapters, we learnt about the application layer and
   transport layer port communication, we also looked at the network layer
   and IPv4 addressing for remote delivery of packets. In this chapter we
   look at the data link layer and discuss how it prepares packets for
   transport over different types of media and physical network
   components, we will also look at some of the Ethernet concepts and
   finally look at the physical layer.

Data link layer

   The data link layer is the 2^nd layer in the OSI model. its function is
   to primarily prepare packets for transmission over the physical media.
   It also serves to control the flow of data that will traverse the
   physical media. The Data Link PDU is the Frame. The two main functions
   performed at this layer include.
     * Framing of packets received from the network layer
     * Control of how data is handled by the physical media through MAC
       (Media Access Control) and detection of errors.

   The devices at this layer are referred to as nodes.

Protocols and services

   In the other layers, most of the protocols were defined by the RFCs.
   However, in the Data Link layer, the IEEE defines most of the
   protocols. We will discuss some of these protocols in chapters on
   switching.

Physical layer

   The OSI model layers that we have discussed previously mainly focus on
   conversion of the data from the user to a form that can be transmitted
   over the physical media. The physical layer which is the 1^st layer of
   the OSI model, is responsible for transmitting the data over the
   different types of physical media that may be present.

   The frames that are received from the data link layer are converted
   into bits for transmission over the medium in this layer. Depending on
   the type of physical medium, the physical layer may represent the bits
   as either; light signals, electrical signals or waves for transmission
   over wireless media.

   The transmission of this bits over the physical media depends on the
   following:
     * The type of medium and its connectors
     * The form of representation of the bits; either electrical, light or
       wave signals
     * The data encoding and the control information
     * The types of transmitters and receivers in the networks

   As we have learnt earlier; by this stage in communication, the user
   data has undergone several processes; segmentation at the transport
   layer, packets in the network layer, encapsulation into frames at the
   data link layer and finally, the data is converted into one of the
   three forms that can be transmitted over the physical media;
   electrical, light signals or microwaves in the physical layer.

   The three main forms of transmission media that we use in networks are:
    1. Copper cable
    2. Fiber
    3. Wireless

   Just like the data link layer, the standards in the data link layer are
   not defined under RFC, however, other standards do exist.

Data carrying capacity in the physical layer

   The various physical media offer transfer of data at different speeds.
   The data transfer rate can be measured using three metrics.
    1. Bandwidth – the capacity of the line. This is measured in bp/s
       (bits per second), kb/s kilobit per second and mb/s megabit per
       second.

   NOTE: you should be careful not to confuse the bandwidth units. The
   symbol used to represent bandwidth is bps or b/s. the letter b is in
   small letters, this is not the same as the storage speed which is
   measured in Bytes per second (Bps) with a capital B.
    1. Throughput – this is the actual transferred data over a certain
       amount of time, in most cases it is usually less than the
       bandwidth.
    2. Goodput – the actual useable data that has been transferred over a
       certain period of time is known as goodput.

Ethernet

   The standards at the layer 1 and 2 of the OSI model are defined as
   Ethernet standards. The different standards used in Ethernet define the
   different layer 1 and layer 2 protocols, however, the format of the
   frame does not change.

   As we mentioned in the previous sections, the data link layer provides
   mechanisms for converting packets to frames while the physical layer
   converts frames to bits which are then transmitted over the physical
   media.

The hub

   In the yester years, the main Ethernet standards in many Local area
   networks was the HUB. The hub used a technique known as the CSMA/CA
   (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Avoidance) and CSMA/CD
   (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Detection). This was
   implemented using either the bus or hub technologies.

   Like the name suggests, the hub was at the heart of communication in a
   network segment and devices could only transmit data one at a time.

   The HUB operates at layer 1, this means that when data is received by a
   hub, it floods this information to all the devices in the network. This
   is a major performance issue since there may be congestion, network
   failure among others.

   NOTE: the area in which the Hub is the center of communication is refer
   to as a collision domain. This is because there is a high possibility
   of collisions.

   The communication in a collision domain such as the one by a hub has
   the following characteristics.
     * Flooding – where frames are sent to all devices in connected to the
       hub.
     * Only one device can communicate at any instance
     * Communication is only one way
     * One collision domain

The switch

   The problems associated with hubs, such as high failure rate due to
   collisions were a major hindrance to growth of networks. As a result, a
   new solution to combat this was introduced. The switch, changed
   communication in networks in many ways, each port on a switch acted as
   a single collision domain, therefore, the switch had as many collision
   domains as it had ports. This meant that the likelihood of collisions
   was reduced. The switch worked at layer 2 as opposed to layer one which
   meant that the switch could learn of the devices on its network and
   instead of flooding frames, unicast communication was possible.

   Further development lead to bidirectional communication, instead of
   only one way communication as seen in hubs, also with switches many
   devices can communicate simultaneously.

   The area where a switch is center of communication is known as a
   broadcast domain. In this type of communication, each port is its own
   collision domain therefore, there are as many collision domains as
   there are switch ports.

   Some of the other characteristics of a switch include:
     * Communication at data-link layer instead of the physical layer
     * Full duplex communication
     * Broadcast domains instead of a single collision domain

   NOTE: Some of the concepts of switching will be discussed at a later
   stage. These concepts are vital and are frequently examined in the CCNA
   composite exam and the ICND 1 and ICND 2 exams.

Summary

   In this chapter, we have looked at the data link layer and how
   communication at layer 2 occurs. We have also looked at the physical
   layer and sending of data over the physical medium as bits. We
   concluded with the Ethernet and looked at communication over a switch
   and a hub. In the next chapter, we will do the basic configuration of a
   router and look at some of the CISCO IOS basics.

Joining Two Buildings With A Glass Link: Everything You Need To Know

   When it comes to innovative, beautiful architectural glazing solutions,
   nothing quite makes a statement like joining two buildings with a glass
   link.
   Date

   28 Apr 2022
   By

   Simon McAuliffe

   A glass corridor between buildings offers a myriad of possibilities: it
   can join old and new structures, protect a historical building, bring
   together luxury home interiors, or effortlessly combine contemporary
   structures. For architects, a glass link provides both a practical and
   an aesthetic solution to elevate all kinds of projects.

   Given the effects of the coronavirus, with more people now working from
   home than ever before, there has been an increase in those choosing to
   move out of the city and into second homes in more rural areas.
   Architects are increasingly now working on high-value historic and
   listed buildings and this is where knowledge of glass links, and the
   various different uses for them, is essential.

   This article examines exactly what a glass link is, the different ways
   one might be used, and the benefits that a glass link between buildings
   can bring to a project.


What is a glass link?


   A glazed corridor between buildings offers so much to a project, and
   can provide so much scope for flexibility when it comes to enhancing a
   building. For those tasked with working on an historical or listed
   building, finding a glazing solution which meets regulations can be
   difficult – but a glass link could be the answer.

   By seamlessly and elegantly combining the old with the new in design,
   glass links can highlight the beauty of original structures, while
   providing a practical walkway or space between two buildings. Not only
   do they connect structures, but they can also be used as functional
   spaces in their own right, which expands the possibilities for any
   architectural proposal.


   The use of a translucent structural material  means that this style of
   extension has minimal impact on the surrounding view from the original
   building to which it is attached. Sight-impeding framework can be kept
   to a minimum, to reduce anything distracting from the view (both from
   inside and outside the structure).

   Low-iron glass can be specified to ensure that any blue or green tint
   is removed from the glass, therefore increasing its transparency and
   the quantity of light filtering through.

   It is worth noting that some heritage organisations require a glass
   linkway to provide a visual divide when adding an extension to a listed
   building – this is important insight for architects working on
   commercial and public buildings, who may be required to work within
   specific guidelines.


Glass links: the details


   When it comes to the product details, glass links offer a whole host of
   benefits ranging from the practical to the aesthetic.

   Visually unobtrusive, glass links are elegantly and carefully designed
   to create a seamless ‘invisible’ effect, ensuring original aesthetics
   are preserved. They are intricately designed to ensure the frame is
   fixed to the original buildings in a precise way, which allows for
   versatility and movement between two buildings. Links can be small or
   large, simple or elaborate, and can be combined with moving or opening
   elements, for additional practical applications.

   A single glazed glass link will provide a fully weather-resistant
   glazed installation (albeit one which might not be the warmest space in
   the building!), whilst double or triple glazing will allow the glass
   linkway to become an integral part of the building’s structure:
   fully-compliant with heat loss requirements, in a design that can be
   used internally, externally, or even designed as a bridge with a glass
   floor for maximum effect.


   Minimal footings are required, as a glass link can be fully sealed with
   silicone, whilst flashing will ensure there is no water penetration.
   Structural glass beams can be incorporated for integrity, and provide a
   robust yet minimal finish (more on this in the last section). Heat
   mirror film and low emissivity glass can help to regulate temperature,
   ensuring interior spaces don’t become too hot or cold, preserve old
   structures, and maintain a pleasant interior climate, regardless of
   weather.


What kind of project does a glass link suit?


   Whether on a listed building as part of planning permission
   considerations, or on a modern new build as a bespoke design feature,
   different elements of high-specification structural glazing can be
   uniquely integrated to create beautiful links between spaces.

   Fixing methods can vary to suit each project’s requirements, with the
   option to secure all fixings into stonework wherever possible for a
   completely frameless look.

   Perhaps the most effective use of a glass link is in connecting old or
   listed buildings to new extensions. They work so well because, in many
   cases, heritage buildings just don’t have the space, structural
   integrity, or planning flexibility required to meet contemporary
   requirements (from both the client, and the council!).

   Adding an extension to an existing structure can often raise
   interesting challenges, particularly if the building is fragile. A
   glass link offers both an aesthetic division, and also a physical
   buffer between the varying architectural and construction standards
   between the two, while preserving original and historical integrity.



Different ways of using a glass link:


   Depending on the project you are specifying for, you might be
   considering the different ways you can create a sense of connection and
   cohesion. Glass links are the ideal solution for a range of
   architectural challenges, and will provide a tangible sense of luxury
   and uniqueness.

   For projects that require new designated walkways, a glass link is a
   fantastic addition. One of our favourite Cantifix projects, aptly named
   ‘Stepping Stone House’ , involved a beautiful outbuilding built on
   stilts over a lake, connected to the main house by a frameless glass
   bridge over the water. The main glulam structure used repeated
   sections, meaning the building is essentially modular, and could be
   elongated or shortened depending on the space available. To give the
   bridge a completely frameless effect, the glass was chased into the
   brickwork – particularly tricky when the old brickwork was not straight
   or level, due to the foundations in water!




   For a truly unique architectural glass solution, a glass bridge link is
   undisputedly special. Another of our projects, Walkers Court, is the
   world’s first and only two-storey frameless glass bridge, using our
   first curved, sliding Pureglaze door. Forming part of the redevelopment
   of the historic Walkers Court district of Soho, this project also
   featured a huge glass wall spanning 7m vertically.




Glass links to introduce natural light

   In today’s modern world, we’ve become hugely dependent on artificial
   light – to the detriment of our physical and psychological health, and
   our overall productivity.

   Exposure to natural light helps our bodies produce Vitamin D, improves
   our circadian rhythms and sleep patterns, helps us to focus, enables us
   to get more done, and even makes us happier. But according to research,
   we now spend close to 90% of our lives indoors – making it difficult to
   experience the benefits of natural light, as we simply aren’t getting
   enough of it.

   A glass link incorporates health-boosting natural light into your
   designs, and creates bright and open spaces. We’ve talked extensively
   about the health benefits of natural light and having a glass link can
   help to improve your physical and psychological health, and overall
   productivity.


What roofs can be used on a glass link?


   There are two options when it comes to fitting a roof onto a glass link
   – a glass roof, or a solid roof.

   Although fitting a glass roof onto a glass link might initially sound
   like a challenge, it isn’t so very different from any other structural
   glass roof design, so the technical details remain relatively similar.
   The main difference is that the roof will need to blend seamlessly with
   the glass link structure, particularly if aesthetics are the primary
   driver for this choice of installation..

   If the glass roof for the glazed link you are specifying is made up of
   multiple panels, then you may need to plan for internal supports below
   the structural silicone joints, between each glass unit. As a general
   rule, you’ll need internal support if the joints are over 1.3m. These
   internal structural supports can be made from a range of materials,
   depending on the look and design of the building. If your client is
   asking for an entire glass design, then a glass beam supporting
   structure is the support system you will need. For maximum strength and
   security, these glass beams will be created using multiple layers of
   low iron glass.

   If you’re specifying a solid roof on a glass link design, then you will
   need to work alongside the glazing supplier and the builder to create
   the structure. A solid roof might not be as aesthetic as a glass roof,
   but it can offer privacy if there are overlooking properties.


Glass Links: final thoughts


   Glass links are a fantastic way to seamlessly connect the old with the
   new. As a material, glass is one of the most sympathetic and versatile
   materials to bring the old and new together in both traditional and
   modern architecture; it can give prominence to traditional features
   while creating contemporary spaces.


   Whether it’s a glass link corridor, or a small and discrete glass link,
   a ‘new-to-old’ design can create an almost invisible transition between
   structures. Linking old buildings with modern designs can present a
   challenge, but here at Cantifix, we take the time necessary to design
   the most suitable and beautiful installation possible.


   If you are looking to include a glass link on a client’s project, get
   in touch with us for help and guidance on the right solution for you.
   Our specialists can assist with any specification enquiries to maximise
   your project’s potential.

   social linking Just about every day I do a Q and A with someone new
   related to Optimize, online marketing in general or about topics
   related to our agency’s marketing consulting practice. It might be prep
   for a journalist interview, blogger interview, Twitter chat or helping
   a friend out with a book like the Q/A below for Rob Garner (VP at
   iCrossing and SEMPO board member).

   Q/A is a great format since so much of search and social media based
   content discovery is about answering questions.  Editorial calendars
   for blogging are useful, but new topics add some nice flavor to the
   theme. Social linking for example. I don’t use that term at all, but
   the practices and outcomes involved are absolutely relevant to
   connecting consumers with brands for business.

   Here are 6 questions and answers on the fundamentals of using a social
   media focused approach for link attraction and acquisition.

   How do you define “social linking”?

   I don’t really use that term but I suppose social linking most often
   means using social media channels to promote content that inspires
   social shares with links. A Tweet, Facebook status update or Pinterest
   pin that includes a link to the content being promoted are all examples
   of social links. Social shares with links = social links.

   It’s worth considering that social channels are also used to promote
   content to communities that include bloggers and journalists who may
   notice and link to the promoted source. Those are not social links per
   se, but they are inspired from content promoted through social
   channels.

   The advancement of social media and SEO integration has created a shift
   from seeking links purely for the potential impact on better search
   visibility to a content focused approach which emphasizes the impact
   that promoted and optimized content can have at attracting traffic
   directly. Social links achieved as a result of promoted content are
   either an equal or a secondary objective.

   How do you define the key types of social links?

   I think social links have different characteristics and so the
   definition depends on what you’re after.

   One marketer might look at links within social shares and discern value
   based on nofollow vs. those that pass PageRank because of a primary
   focus on traditional SEO.  Another marketer might evaluate links based
   on how much traffic was sent in a particular time frame, additional
   levels of shares of the link and overall propagation because of a focus
   on awareness, branding and reach.

   Other basic social link characteristics or types might include:
     * Content shared on social channels that includes a link (temporal
       and permanent)
     * Links contained within feeds (RSS, fire hose, syndicated)
     * Links contained on social profile web pages
     * Clean links that pass PageRank
     * Nofollow or crawler “un friendly” links
     * Shortened links/URLs

   With so many social networks using the nofollow attribute, do you see
   any indirect search benefits from sharing in these networks?

   The most important value from content promotion through social networks
   is to create awareness, interest and consideration for people that
   interact with the information.  People that are empowered to publish
   through blogging, commenting or other social content sharing may decide
   to act on content they’ve been exposed to through social channels in
   the form of a link to it.

   It’s completely up to the discretion of search engines to adhere to
   nofollow, or not. Search engine policies and terms of use are not
   something we can control, so approaching direct and indirect benefits
   from links within social channels should focus on the ability to affect
   a target audience first and foremost. Doing so in a search engine
   friendly way can make that effort even more effective.

   If nofollow social links are of little SEO value now, who’s to say
   search engines won’t value them in a different way that could be come a
   SEO or Social SEO asset in the future? If the links provide value to
   the influencers and followers we’re trying to reach and they act on
   those links in a meaningful, measurable way, then the most important
   objective is achieved.

   How much of an impact do you believe social linking is having on search
   engine algorithms for non-logged in and non-personalized users?

   The links contained in the millions of social shares that happen on a
   regular basis is too rich (in my opinion) for search engines to ignore
   completely. If content resonates with a community and they actively
   share that content at an accelerated rate, I can’t imagine why a search
   engine would not factor that signal for generic searches. It might not
   be a signal with substantial influence now for logged out users, but I
   suspect it will grow proportionate to the growth of social network
   usage.

   It’s important not to forget the ancillary impact of social shares with
   links that surface interesting content to people who decide to create
   “follow” links from their blogs, in comments or from other content
   sources that are outside of social networks. That’s an example of
   social linking that can impact search, albeit, indirectly.

   How do you view the measurement of social links, versus traditional
   links?

   Social shares with links are important for driving traffic and creating
   awareness of content. The extent that they can be a signal for generic
   search or logged in search is a value too. The authority of authors
   that share the links, the rate and quantity of social shares and the
   topics associated with source and destination are all worth considering
   when evaluating social links.

   The reason why the link is created, the context, is as important as the
   distinction of social vs. traditional. A blogger might link to another
   web page or blog within an article that contains hundreds of words.  A
   link within a Tweet might only involve a handful of words. But that
   same link could be re-tweeted hundreds of times in a very short period
   of time. It’s less likely that hundreds of bloggers would write blog
   posts including hundreds of words within a similarly short period of
   time.

   The anchor text and page/domain authority of the source are important
   values for traditional links. The annotation (since there is no anchor
   text with a social link) and rate of link duplication/propagation are
   important values for a social link. I think there’s still value to the
   cumulative number of social links but not in the same way as
   traditional page-to-page links.

   Is there an ROI on social linking, or should marketers approach the
   same as link building, in the sense that it is known to be a key
   cornerstone for achieving higher visibility?

   I would evaluate based on determining whether social linking is
   contributing to identified goals.  Social linking purely for achieving
   higher search visibility is a narrow view and leaves a lot of value
   unrealized.  Inspiring social shares of relevant and optimized content
   can drive direct traffic, additional waves of awareness and provide
   longer-term benefits for visibility through search.  New content
   discovery through social media often motivates a search. Brand
   awareness when searching can result in greater clickthroughs in the
   SERPs, even if the position is beyond 1, 2 or 3.

The State Department LinkTree Alternative.

   Brought to you by GPA Mission Website Platforms, Digital Strategy 
   Training, and Digital Lab.
     __________________________________________________________________

   GPA Digital Lab (LAB) has designed and launched a new product for
   social media content strategy in collaboration with the Digital
   Strategy  Training team and Mission Website Platforms (MWP).

   Social Links was launched on April 1, 2021 and received valuable
   feedback during the initial 30-day pilot. We are happy to announce that
   Social Links is now available for all Missions to use!
   Social Links Promo Video

What is Social Links?

   Social Links is a tool developed and owned by the Department of State
   that enables Department social media practitioners and content managers
   to provide their audiences with a secure way to view promoted content.
   Social Links enhances content strategy in a similar way as other
   popular tools on the market, such as Link in Bio or Linktree. The
   Social Links URL is placed in an Instagram account bio to drive traffic
   towards calls to action, downstream web properties and valuable content
   that your Mission wants to promote.

   LAB designed the first iteration of Social Links with Missions in mind
   by tailoring features to fit the specific needs of staff in the field
   based on real user feedback. It was designed as a plugin for WordPress
   and is already installed on the Mission Website Platform administrative
   site. It can be activated on your site by request and Social Link pages
   are hosted as part of your existing Mission website.

Why Use Social Links?

   Third-party platforms, like LinkTree, are not FedRAMP approved, which
   focuses on the security and protection of sensitive federal information
   within cloud technologies. By creating a State Department-owned version
   of these tools, Social Links is able provide valuable benefits specific
   to the Department’s unique needs. They include:
     * Security: Using a third-party platform that is not FedRAMP approved
       poses security risks to the Department. Since Social Links is
       installed on the Mission Website Platform, it inherits the security
       standards already in place on your current website.
     * Branding: Social Links provides cohesive branding through two style
       templates that match both the legacy Mission websites as well as
       the new redesigned sites launched this year.
     * Traffic: Using a third-party platform sends valuable traffic away
       from DOS web properties but because Social Links is hosted on your
       Mission website, all initial web traffic stays within DOS
       properties. Since Google Analytics is already in use for your
       Mission website, you have access to powerful analytics for Social
       Links as well.
     * Access: Mission staff can easily access and manage Social Links
       through your Mission website administration site.

Requesting Social Links

   To request activation of a new Social Links page, please work with your
   MWP Web Manager to complete this form.

   The form will request the following information:
     * Post name and primary contact
     * Mission website URL
     * Which version of MWP you’re on (2021 redesign or legacy)
     * Preferred format (grid or list)
     * Links to other social properties, like Instagram, Facebook, etc.
     * Preferred URL for your Social Links page (Example:
       https://do.usembassy.gov/embajadausaenrd/ )

     * Users that will need access to manage your Social Links page (Note:
       users that are not approved MWP users will need to complete an
       extra step requiring management approval to authorize site access;
       users must also have an america.gov account)

   To request additional users for existing posts, please refer to the
   following instructions document.

User Guides  Training

   To ensure you’ll benefit from all the features available in  Social
   Links, the LAB  developed a step-by-step user guide with screenshots
   (refer to the Guide for Social Media Managers section). The LAB also
   hosted two training sessions for our pilot group, which are available
   below.

   If you’ve created a Facebook page or Twitter account for your business,
   chances are, you would've already linked to your website within your
   profile.


   After all, you don’t just want your followers to simply check out your
   status updates and call it a day -- you want them to click through to
   your website, and hopefully convert into a paying user.


   What many business owners neglect, though, is linking to their social
   media profiles on their website.


   Why is it important to add social media links on your website, and how
   do you go about adding these links? In this article, we explore all
   that, and more.


   Quick aside: just so we’re clear, we’re talking about social media
   links, not social media share links or sharing buttons. If you want to
   learn more about utilizing social media share links to promote your
   content, we’ll be sharing an article about this in future.


What are Social Media Links?


   Social media links are clickable icons or buttons that can be displayed
   on your website that direct your visitors to your various social media
   accounts.


   These links typically appear as icons representing popular social media
   platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest,
   YouTube, and more.


   By integrating social media links on a website, you provide visitors
   with an easy and direct way to connect with you or your business on
   various social platforms.


Why are Social Media Links Important for Your Website?


   At the most basic level, adding social media links on your website
   helps you grow your followers. that aside, you’ll also be able to
   achieve other goals and objectives by featuring your social media
   accounts on your website. Read on to find out more!

1. Nurture Your Website Visitors Via Social Media Links

   Say you get 100 visitors who land on your website, every day.


   The average website conversion rate is a low, low 2.35%, so this means
   that approximately 2 of your visitors will convert as paying customers,
   and the other 98 will churn away into oblivion. Such a pity, huh?

   nurturing website visitors


   Now, adding social media links on your website is a great way to keep
   in touch with these consumers, and stay at the forefront of their
   consciousness.


   Assuming you have great content on your social media platforms, and
   your site visitors decide to follow you, you basically get a chance to
   nurture them through your content (both organic and paid).


   The goal is to achieve top-of-mind awareness, and convert them further
   down the road.


   At this point, you might be wondering: can’t I do the same with an
   email list? Yes, that’s true, but most consumers don’t sign up for a
   mailing list unless you’re dangling a carrot in front of them.


   If you’re a SaaS business, you might have to give away a free eBook or
   trial. If you’re in the eCommerce line, the standard practice is to
   offer a promo code when someone signs up for your mailing list.


   The bottom line? All things considered, there’s less friction
   associated with a consumer following a brand of Facebook, as opposed to
   signing up for their mailing list.


   You can still offer a newsletter sign-up, of course. But for your site
   visitors who aren’t comfortable with joining your list or parting with
   their email, take the conversation over to social media instead!

2. Build Trust and Demonstrate Authenticity

   In this day and age, authenticity is everything. 90% of millennials and
   85% of Gen X consumers say that authenticity plays a key role in
   influencing which brands they support; data has also shown that
   authentic brands tend to attract more “high-value” customers.


   sign be authentic


   While many companies do have an “Our Story” page that details their CSR
   initiatives or how they give back to society, you can go one step
   further and demonstrate authenticity via your social media posts.


   Here’s an example: if your brand’s selling point is that all your
   products are made in the USA, posting weekly #behindthescenes photos
   and videos (and encouraging your website visitors click through and
   view this content!) will make your story more convincing.


   At the end of the day, consumers are no longer looking for a
   well-polished brand that says all the right things.


   Instead, they want to put their money behind brands which are
   authentic, meaningful, and transparent.


   By guiding your site visitors off your corporate page, and to your
   social media profiles, you can connect with them in a more meaningful
   way, and show them who you truly are.

3. Improve Search Rankings

   Interestingly enough, adding social media links for websites may
   increase your website’s visibility on search engines.


   Google has previously stated that companies should link to their
   Google+ page on their website because it “provides Google with
   information (...) to help determine the relevancy of your site to a
   user query on Google Search.”


   graph improve search rankings social media


   Full disclaimer: we don’t have a ton of information on how this works.


   If you do a quick search, you’ll see that a good deal of the online
   discourse revolves around how Google+ is useful for promoting content
   that you post on the platform itself (NOT how it gives your website SEO
   juice).


   That said, it’s simple to add social media links on your website, so if
   there’s even a small chance that this can improve your search rankings,
   why not go for it?


How to Add Social Media Links To Your Website


   Want to get your social media links up and running? Check out these
   guides for the various CMS platforms.

     * Adding And Setting Up A Social Bar [Wix]
     * Add Social Icons [Weebly]
     * Add Social Media Buttons [Shopify]



Best Practices for Including Social Media Links on Your Website

1. Strategically Place the Icons

   Place the social media icons in a visible location so that visitors can
   easily spot and click on them to access your social profiles. The
   header, footer, or sidebar are all great options.

2. Use Recognizable Icons

   Use recognizable and standardized icons for popular social media
   platforms to ensure visitors can quickly identify and associate them
   with the respective platforms. Icons with the platform's official
   colors and designs are recommended.

3. Maintain Consistency

   Maintain a consistent style for your social media icons in terms of
   size, design, and spacing. Consistency across your website enhances the
   overall aesthetic and provides a cohesive user experience.

4. Opt for a Simple Design

   Keep the design of the social media icons simple and uncluttered. You
   want to avoid excessive animation or flashy effects that can distract
   visitors from the main content of your website.

5. Include Alt Text

   Add descriptive alt text to your social media icons for accessibility
   purposes. Alt text allows screen readers to describe the icon to users
   with visual impairments, improving the inclusivity of your website.


   social media icons

6. Open Links in a New Tab

   Configure the social media links to open in a new browser tab. This
   ensures that visitors can easily return to your website after visiting
   your social media profiles.

7. Link to Active Profiles

   Double-check that the social media links direct visitors to your
   current and active profiles.


   Outdated or inactive profiles can create a negative impression and
   diminish trust in your online presence. It also creates a bad user
   experience which affects the overall perception of your brand.

8. Utilize Hover Effects

   Incorporate subtle hover effects on the social media icons to show
   visitors that the icons are clickable.

9. Prioritize Relevant Platforms

   Feature the social media platforms that align with your target audience
   and business objectives.


   Highlighting the platforms where you are most active and engaged is
   also a great way to ensure that our target audience knows where to go
   for regular updates about your company.

10. Regularly Update Links

   Periodically review and update your social media links to ensure they
   remain current and relevant. It’s also important to add any new
   platforms you've joined and remove any obsolete ones.


In Conlusion


   Including social media links on your website is a fundamental step in
   building a robust online presence and expanding your reach to a broader
   audience.


   By implementing these best practices, you can seamlessly integrate
   social media icons into your website and encourage meaningful
   engagement with your audience across various platforms.

       On Snapchat, “link” means you added a clickable link to your snap.
       Whether you post a pic or a video snap, you can include a link, or
       website URL, at the bottom of it. Once you’re done creating your
       snap and applying any add-ons—like stickers—that you like, tap the
       link icon on the right-hand menu. Type or paste the URL, then
       select Allow to enable it. Choose Attach to Snap at the bottom.
       Your friends and followers will see the link at the bottom of your
       snap and be able to “swipe up” on it.^[1] X Research source

            Anyone on Snapchat can use this feature—you can send a
            clickable link as a private snap to your friends or as a
            public story to your followers.
          + Add a caption to your snap like, “This news story is
            mind-blowing! 🤯 Check it out!”
          + Draw attention to a vid with a comment like, “Watch this clip
            of fox playing fetch! 🦊 Cute!”
          + Talk about a URL for a charity or a fundraiser with words
            like, “Let’s raise $$ for children’s hospitals! 🏥”

       On Snapchat, "link" may also mean you want to add someone as a
       friend. Maybe you want to exchange memes or secrets with a buddy,
       so you want to talk to them on Snapchat. You might’ve also met
       someone on a dating app, like Tinder or Bumble, and you’re not
       ready to give them your number yet. In this case, you’ll ask to
       “link up” on Snapchat so you can send pics and video chat.
          + “Hey, let’s link up on Snapchat! I wanna spill so much tea.
            😈☕”
          + “OMG. We should totally link up and make our own memes. 🤣 Add
            me on Snapchat!”

            this to Snapchat”

   Link is the main charectar Shigeru Miyamotoʼs classic series "Zelda".
   He was named link because Shiggy thought of him as the "Link" between
   the player and the game world. He is a Hylian, an elfish type charcetar
   from the land of hyrule. In most games, he is young (looks about 12,
   but he becomes an adult for Half of OOT), with golden-blond or brown
   hair, and wears a Green tunic. Except for OOT and MM, link is reborn in
   a diffrent time and storyline in every game (as is Princess Zelda)
   and prevents ganondorf, the evil wizard guy who was the only male born
   amoung the Geurdos, from stealing the triforce. The storylines do
   relate to each other tho (espically in Wind Waker)

   The Legend of Zelda series (which is poorly named, considering that
   itʼs Link that does most of the legendary stuff) features Link as its
   main character. He is world renown for dressing like a flamboyant elf,
   swinging his big thing around (his sword, I mean), and never saying
   anything, even when heʼs being stoned to death by Octoroks.
   Ganon: Time to die, Link.

   HomeInternet TermsLink Definition

Link

   A link (short for hyperlink) is an HTML object that allows you to jump
   to a new location when you click or tap it. Links are found on almost
   every webpage and provide a simple means of navigating between pages on
   the web.

   Links can be attached to text, images, or other HTML elements. Most
   text links are blue since that is the standard color web browsers use
   to display links. However, links can be any color since the style of
   the link text may be customized using HTML or CSS styles. In the early
   days of the web, links were underlined by default. Today, underlining
   links is less common.

   When a link is applied to an image, the link tag encapsulates, or
   surrounds the image tag. Since the image tag is nested inside the link
   tag, the image itself becomes a link. This method can be used to apply
   links to other elements such as div and span objects. However,
   since CSS can be used to stylize a link, an a tag with a CSS class or
   ID attribute is often used in place of a div or span tag.

   Below is an example of the HTML for a text and image link:

   Text Link: a href="/definition/computer"Computer Definition/a

   Image Link: a href="https://techterms.com/definition/computer"img
   src="/images/computer.jpg" alt="desktop PC"/a

Relative and Absolute Links

   The first link above is a "relative link" because it does not include
   the domain name. Instead, the link is relative to the current website.
   Any internal link on TechTerms.com, for example, does not need
   "https://techterms.com/" in the source. Rather, a relative link like
   "/definition/computer" is all that is required. Since the link starts
   with a forward slash, the path begins with the root directory. If a
   relative link does not start with a forward slash, the path is relative
   to the current URL.

   The second link above is an absolute link because it includes the
   domain name. Absolute links are required for external links, which
   direct you to another website. They may begin with "http" or "https."
   Absolute links may also begin with two forward slashes ("//"). This is
   interpreted as "http://" for pages served via HTTP and "https://" for
   pages served via HTTPS.

   NOTE: The "a" in the a tag stands for "anchor," since early hypertext
   documents often linked to anchors (or markers) within a page rather
   than other pages. The "href" within an a stands for "hypertext
   reference."

12.1 Introduction to links and anchors

   HTML offers many of the conventional publishing idioms for rich text
   and structured documents, but what separates it from most other markup
   languages is its features for hypertext and interactive documents. This
   section introduces the link (or hyperlink, or Web link), the basic
   hypertext construct. A link is a connection from one Web resource to
   another. Although a simple concept, the link has been one of the
   primary forces driving the success of the Web.

   A link has two ends -- called anchors -- and a direction. The link
   starts at the "source" anchor and points to the "destination" anchor,
   which may be any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound
   bite, a program, an HTML document, an element within an HTML document,
   etc.).

  12.1.1 Visiting a linked resource

   The default behavior associated with a link is the retrieval of another
   Web resource. This behavior is commonly and implicitly obtained by
   selecting the link (e.g., by clicking, through keyboard input, etc.).

   The following HTML excerpt contains two links, one whose destination
   anchor is an HTML document named "chapter2.html" and the other whose
   destination anchor is a GIF image in the file "forest.gif":
BODY
...some text...
PYou'll find a lot more in  A href="chapter2.html"chapter two/A.
See also this A href="../images/forest.gif"map of the enchanted forest./A
/BODY

   By activating these links (by clicking with the mouse, through keyboard
   input, voice commands, etc.), users may visit these resources. Note
   that the href attribute in each source anchor specifies the address of
   the destination anchor with a URI.

   The destination anchor of a link may be an element within an HTML
   document. The destination anchor must be given an anchor name and any
   URI addressing this anchor must include the name as its fragment
   identifier.

   Destination anchors in HTML documents may be specified either by the A
   element (naming it with the name attribute), or by any other element
   (naming with the id attribute).

   Thus, for example, an author might create a table of contents whose
   entries link to header elements H2, H3, etc., in the same document.
   Using the A element to create destination anchors, we would write:
H1Table of Contents/H1
PA href="#section1"Introduction/ABR
A href="#section2"Some background/ABR
A href="#section2.1"On a more personal note/ABR
...the rest of the table of contents...
...the document body...
H2A name="section1"Introduction/A/H2
...section 1...
H2A name="section2"Some background/A/H2
...section 2...
H3A name="section2.1"On a more personal note/A/H3
...section 2.1...

   We may achieve the same effect by making the header elements themselves
   the anchors:
H1Table of Contents/H1
PA href="#section1"Introduction/ABR
A href="#section2"Some background/ABR
A href="#section2.1"On a more personal note/ABR
...the rest of the table of contents...
...the document body...
H2 id="section1"Introduction/H2
...section 1...
H2 id="section2"Some background/H2

  12.1.2 Other link relationships

   By far the most common use of a link is to retrieve another Web
   resource, as illustrated in the previous examples. However, authors may
   insert links in their documents that express other relationships
   between resources than simply "activate this link to visit that related
   resource". Links that express other types of relationships have one or
   more link types specified in their source anchor.

   The roles of a link defined by A or LINK are specified via the rel and
   rev attributes.

   For instance, links defined by the LINK element may describe the
   position of a document within a series of documents. In the following
   excerpt, links within the document entitled "Chapter 5" point to the
   previous and next chapters:
HEAD
...other head information...
TITLEChapter 5/TITLE
LINK rel="prev" href="chapter4.html"
LINK rel="next" href="chapter6.html"
/HEAD

   The link type of the first link is "prev" and that of the second is
   "next" (two of several recognized link types). Links specified by LINK
   are not rendered with the document's contents, although user agents may
   render them in other ways (e.g., as navigation tools).

   Even if they are not used for navigation, these links may be
   interpreted in interesting ways. For example, a user agent that prints
   a series of HTML documents as a single document may use this link
   information as the basis of forming a coherent linear document. Further
   information is given below on using links for the benefit of search
   engines.

  12.1.3 Specifying anchors and links

   Although several HTML elements and attributes create links to other
   resources (e.g., the IMG element, the FORM element, etc.), this chapter
   discusses links and anchors created by the LINK and A elements. The
   LINK element may only appear in the head of a document. The A element
   may only appear in the body.

   When the A element's href attribute is set, the element defines a
   source anchor for a link that may be activated by the user to retrieve
   a Web resource. The source anchor is the location of the A instance and
   the destination anchor is the Web resource.

   The retrieved resource may be handled by the user agent in several
   ways: by opening a new HTML document in the same user agent window,
   opening a new HTML document in a different window, starting a new
   program to handle the resource, etc. Since the A element has content
   (text, images, etc.), user agents may render this content in such a way
   as to indicate the presence of a link (e.g., by underlining the
   content).

   When the name or id attributes of the A element are set, the element
   defines an anchor that may be the destination of other links.

   Authors may set the name and href attributes simultaneously in the same
   A instance.

   The LINK element defines a relationship between the current document
   and another resource. Although LINK has no content, the relationships
   it defines may be rendered by some user agents.

  12.1.4 Link titles

   The title attribute may be set for both A and LINK to add information
   about the nature of a link. This information may be spoken by a user
   agent, rendered as a tool tip, cause a change in cursor image, etc.

   Thus, we may augment a previous example by supplying a title for each
   link:
BODY
...some text...
PYou'll find a lot more in A href="chapter2.html"
       title="Go to chapter two"chapter two/A.
A href="./chapter2.html"
       title="Get chapter two."chapter two/A.
See also this A href="../images/forest.gif"
       title="GIF image of enchanted forest"map of
the enchanted forest./A
/BODY

  12.1.5 Internationalization and links

   Since links may point to documents encoded with different character
   encodings, the A and LINK elements support the charset attribute. This
   attribute allows authors to advise user agents about the encoding of
   data at the other end of the link.

   The hreflang attribute provides user agents with information about the
   language of a resource at the end of a link, just as the lang attribute
   provides information about the language of an element's content or
   attribute values.

   Armed with this additional knowledge, user agents should be able to
   avoid presenting "garbage" to the user. Instead, they may either locate
   resources necessary for the correct presentation of the document or, if
   they cannot locate the resources, they should at least warn the user
   that the document will be unreadable and explain the cause.

12.2 The A element

!ELEMENT A - - (%inline;)* -(A)       -- anchor --
!ATTLIST A
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --

   Attribute definitions

   name = cdata [CS]
          This attribute names the current anchor so that it may be the
          destination of another link. The value of this attribute must be
          a unique anchor name. The scope of this name is the current
          document. Note that this attribute shares the same name space as
          the id attribute.

   href = uri [CT]
          This attribute specifies the location of a Web resource, thus
          defining a link between the current element (the source anchor)
          and the destination anchor defined by this attribute.

   hreflang = langcode [CI]
          This attribute specifies the base language of the resource
          designated by href and may only be used when href is specified.

   type = content-type [CI]
          This attribute gives an advisory hint as to the content type of
          the content available at the link target address. It allows user
          agents to opt to use a fallback mechanism rather than fetch the
          content if they are advised that they will get content in a
          content type they do not support.
          Authors who use this attribute take responsibility to manage the
          risk that it may become inconsistent with the content available
          at the link target address.
          For the current list of registered content types, please consult
          [MIMETYPES].

   rel = link-types [CI]
          This attribute describes the relationship from the current
          document to the anchor specified by the href attribute. The
          value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link types.

   rev = link-types [CI]
          This attribute is used to describe a reverse link from the
          anchor specified by the href attribute to the current document.
          The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link
          types.

   charset = charset [CI]
          This attribute specifies the character encoding of the resource
          designated by the link. Please consult the section on character
          encodings for more details.

   Attributes defined elsewhere
     * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
     * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
     * title (element title)
     * style (inline style information )
     * shape and coords (image maps)
     * onfocus, onblur, onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup,
       onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown,
       onkeyup (intrinsic events )
     * target (target frame information)
     * tabindex (tabbing navigation)
     * accesskey (access keys)

   Each A element defines an anchor
    1. The A element's content defines the position of the anchor.
    2. The name attribute names the anchor so that it may be the
       destination of zero or more links (see also anchors with id).
    3. The href attribute makes this anchor the source anchor of exactly
       one link.

   Authors may also create an A element that specifies no anchors, i.e.,
   that doesn't specify href, name, or id. Values for these attributes may
   be set at a later time through scripts.

   In the example that follows, the A element defines a link. The source
   anchor is the text "W3C Web site" and the destination anchor is
   "http://www.w3.org/":
For more information about W3C, please consult the
A href="http://www.w3.org/"W3C Web site/A.

   This link designates the home page of the World Wide Web Consortium.
   When a user activates this link in a user agent, the user agent will
   retrieve the resource, in this case, an HTML document.

   User agents generally render links in such a way as to make them
   obvious to users (underlining, reverse video, etc.). The exact
   rendering depends on the user agent. Rendering may vary according to
   whether the user has already visited the link or not. A possible visual
   rendering of the previous link might be:
For more information about W3C, please consult the W3C Web site.
                                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To tell user agents explicitly what the character encoding of the
   destination page is, set the charset attribute:
For more information about W3C, please consult the
A href="http://www.w3.org/" charset="ISO-8859-1"W3C Web site/A

   Suppose we define an anchor named "anchor-one" in the file "one.html".
...text before the anchor...
A name="anchor-one"This is the location of anchor one./A
...text after the anchor...

   This creates an anchor around the text "This is the location of anchor
   one.". Usually, the contents of A are not rendered in any special way
   when A defines an anchor only.

   Having defined the anchor, we may link to it from the same or another
   document. URIs that designate anchors contain a "#" character followed
   by the anchor name (the fragment identifier). Here are some examples of
   such URIs:
     * An absolute URI: http://www.mycompany.com/one.html#anchor-one
     * A relative URI: ./one.html#anchor-one or one.html#anchor-one
     * When the link is defined in the same document: #anchor-one

   Thus, a link defined in the file "two.html" in the same directory as
   "one.html" would refer to the anchor as follows:
...text before the link...
For more information, please consult A href="./one.html#anchor-one" anchor one
/A.
...text after the link...

   The A element in the following example specifies a link (with href) and
   creates a named anchor (with name) simultaneously:
I just returned from vacation! Here's a
A name="anchor-two"
   href="http://www.somecompany.com/People/Ian/vacation/family.png"
photo of my family at the lake./A.

   This example contains a link to a different type of Web resource (a PNG
   image). Activating the link should cause the image resource to be
   retrieved from the Web (and possibly displayed if the system has been
   configured to do so).

   Note. User agents should be able to find anchors created by empty A
   elements, but some fail to do so. For example, some user agents may not
   find the "empty-anchor" in the following HTML fragment:
A name="empty-anchor"/A
EM...some HTML.../EM
A href="#empty-anchor"Link to empty anchor/A

  12.2.1 Syntax of anchor names

   An anchor name is the value of either the name or id attribute when
   used in the context of anchors. Anchor names must observe the following
   rules:
     * Uniqueness: Anchor names must be unique within a document. Anchor
       names that differ only in case may not appear in the same document.
     * String matching: Comparisons between fragment identifiers and
       anchor names must be done by exact (case-sensitive) match.

   Thus, the following example is correct with respect to string matching
   and must be considered a match by user agents:
PA href="#xxx".../A
...more document...
PA name="xxx".../A

   ILLEGAL EXAMPLE:
   The following example is illegal with respect to uniqueness since the
   two names are the same except for case:
PA name="xxx".../A
PA name="XXX".../A

   Although the following excerpt is legal HTML, the behavior of the user
   agent is not defined; some user agents may (incorrectly) consider this
   a match and others may not.
PA href="#xxx".../A
...more document...
PA name="XXX".../A

   Anchor names should be restricted to ASCII characters. Please consult
   the appendix for more information about non-ASCII characters in URI
   attribute values.

  12.2.2 Nested links are illegal

   Links and anchors defined by the A element must not be nested; an A
   element must not contain any other A elements.

   Since the DTD defines the LINK element to be empty, LINK elements may
   not be nested either.

  12.2.3 Anchors with the id attribute

   The id attribute may be used to create an anchor at the start tag of
   any element (including the A element).

   This example illustrates the use of the id attribute to position an
   anchor in an H2 element. The anchor is linked to via the A element.
You may read more about this in A href="#section2"Section Two/A.
...later in the document
H2 id="section2"Section Two/H2
...later in the document
PPlease refer to A href="#section2"Section Two/A above
for more details.

   The following example names a destination anchor with the id attribute:
I just returned from vacation! Here's a
A id="anchor-two"photo of my family at the lake./A.

   The id and name attributes share the same name space. This means that
   they cannot both define an anchor with the same name in the same
   document. It is permissible to use both attributes to specify an
   element's unique identifier for the following elements: A, APPLET,
   FORM, FRAME, IFRAME, IMG, and MAP. When both attributes are used on a
   single element, their values must be identical.

   ILLEGAL EXAMPLE:
   The following excerpt is illegal HTML since these attributes declare
   the same name twice in the same document.
A href="#a1".../A
...
H1 id="a1"
...pages and pages...
A name="a1"/A

   The following example illustrates that id and name must be the same
   when both appear in an element's start tag:
PA name="a1" id="a1" href="#a1".../A

   Because of its specification in the HTML DTD, the name attribute may
   contain character references. Thus, the value D#xfc;rst is a valid
   name attribute value, as is Duuml;rst . The id attribute, on the other
   hand, may not contain character references.

   Use id or name? Authors should consider the following issues when
   deciding whether to use id or name for an anchor name:
     * The id attribute can act as more than just an anchor name (e.g.,
       style sheet selector, processing identifier, etc.).
     * Some older user agents don't support anchors created with the id
       attribute.
     * The name attribute allows richer anchor names (with entities).

  12.2.4 Unavailable and unidentifiable resources

   A reference to an unavailable or unidentifiable resource is an error.
   Although user agents may vary in how they handle such an error, we
   recommend the following behavior:
     * If a user agent cannot locate a linked resource, it should alert
       the user.
     * If a user agent cannot identify the type of a linked resource, it
       should still attempt to process it. It should alert the user and
       may allow the user to intervene and identify the document type.

12.3 Document relationships: the LINK element

!ELEMENT LINK - O EMPTY               -- a media-independent link --
!ATTLIST LINK
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  charset     %Charset;      #IMPLIED  -- char encoding of linked resource --
  href        %URI;          #IMPLIED  -- URI for linked resource --
  hreflang    %LanguageCode; #IMPLIED  -- language code --
  type        %ContentType;  #IMPLIED  -- advisory content type --
  rel         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- forward link types --
  rev         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- reverse link types --
  media       %MediaDesc;    #IMPLIED  -- for rendering on these media --
  

   Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

   Attributes defined elsewhere
     * id, class (document-wide identifiers)
     * lang (language information), dir (text direction)
     * title (element title)
     * style (inline style information )
     * onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover,
       onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup (intrinsic
       events )
     * href, hreflang, type, rel, rev (links and anchors)
     * target (target frame information)
     * media (header style information)
     * charset(character encodings)

   This element defines a link. Unlike A, it may only appear in the HEAD
   section of a document, although it may appear any number of times.
   Although LINK has no content, it conveys relationship information that
   may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways (e.g., a tool-bar
   with a drop-down menu of links).

   This example illustrates how several LINK definitions may appear in the
   HEAD section of a document. The current document is "Chapter2.html".
   The rel attribute specifies the relationship of the linked document
   with the current document. The values "Index", "Next", and "Prev" are
   explained in the section on link types.
!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"
HTML
HEAD
  TITLEChapter 2/TITLE
  LINK rel="Index" href="../index.html"
  LINK rel="Next"  href="Chapter3.html"
  LINK rel="Prev"  href="Chapter1.html"
/HEAD
...the rest of the document...

  12.3.1 Forward and reverse links

   The rel and rev attributes play complementary roles -- the rel
   attribute specifies a forward link and the rev attribute specifies a
   reverse link.

   Consider two documents A and B.
Document A:       LINK href="docB" rel="foo"

   Has exactly the same meaning as:
Document B:       LINK href="docA" rev="foo"

   Both attributes may be specified simultaneously.

  12.3.2 Links and external style sheets

   When the LINK element links an external style sheet to a document, the
   type attribute specifies the style sheet language and the media
   attribute specifies the intended rendering medium or media. User agents
   may save time by retrieving from the network only those style sheets
   that apply to the current device.

   Media types are further discussed in the section on style sheets.

  12.3.3 Links and search engines

   Authors may use the LINK element to provide a variety of information to
   search engines, including:
     * Links to alternate versions of a document, written in another human
       language.
     * Links to alternate versions of a document, designed for different
       media, for instance a version especially suited for printing.
     * Links to the starting page of a collection of documents.

   The examples below illustrate how language information, media types,
   and link types may be combined to improve document handling by search
   engines.

   In the following example, we use the hreflang attribute to tell search
   engines where to find Dutch, Portuguese, and Arabic versions of a
   document. Note the use of the charset attribute for the Arabic manual.
   Note also the use of the lang attribute to indicate that the value of
   the title attribute for the LINK element designating the French manual
   is in French.
HEAD
TITLEThe manual in English/TITLE
LINK title="The manual in Dutch"
      type="text/html"
      rel="alternate"
      hreflang="nl"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/dutch.html"
LINK title="The manual in Portuguese"
      type="text/html"
      rel="alternate"
      hreflang="pt"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/portuguese.html"
LINK title="The manual in Arabic"
      type="text/html"
      rel="alternate"
      charset="ISO-8859-6"
      hreflang="ar"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/arabic.html"
LINK lang="fr" title="La documentation en Franccedil;ais"
      type="text/html"
      rel="alternate"
      hreflang="fr"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/french.html"
/HEAD

   In the following example, we tell search engines where to find the
   printed version of a manual.
HEAD
TITLEReference manual/TITLE
LINK media="print" title="The manual in postscript"
      type="application/postscript"
      rel="alternate"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/postscript.ps"
/HEAD

   In the following example, we tell search engines where to find the
   front page of a collection of documents.
HEAD
TITLEReference manual -- Page 5/TITLE
LINK rel="Start" title="The first page of the manual"
      type="text/html"
      href="http://someplace.com/manual/start.html"
/HEAD

   Further information is given in the notes in the appendix on helping
   search engines index your Web site.

12.4 Path information: the BASE element

!ELEMENT BASE - O EMPTY               -- document base URI --
!ATTLIST BASE
  href        %URI;          #REQUIRED -- URI that acts as base URI --
  

   Start tag: required, End tag: forbidden

   Attribute definitions

   href = uri [CT]
          This attribute specifies an absolute URI that acts as the base
          URI for resolving relative URIs.

   Attributes defined elsewhere
     * target (target frame information)

   In HTML, links and references to external images, applets,
   form-processing programs, style sheets, etc. are always specified by a
   URI. Relative URIs are resolved according to a base URI, which may come
   from a variety of sources. The BASE element allows authors to specify a
   document's base URI explicitly.

   When present, the BASE element must appear in the HEAD section of an
   HTML document, before any element that refers to an external source.
   The path information specified by the BASE element only affects URIs in
   the document where the element appears.

   For example, given the following BASE declaration and A declaration:
!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"
HTML
 HEAD
   TITLEOur Products/TITLE
   BASE href="http://www.aviary.com/products/intro.html"
 /HEAD

 BODY
   PHave you seen our A href="../cages/birds.gif"Bird Cages/A?
 /BODY
/HTML

   the relative URI "../cages/birds.gif" would resolve to:
http://www.aviary.com/cages/birds.gif

  12.4.1 Resolving relative URIs

   User agents must calculate the base URI for resolving relative URIs
   according to [RFC1808], section 3. The following describes how
   [RFC1808] applies specifically to HTML.

   User agents must calculate the base URI according to the following
   precedences (highest priority to lowest):
    1. The base URI is set by the BASE element.
    2. The base URI is given by meta data discovered during a protocol
       interaction, such as an HTTP header (see [RFC2616]).
    3. By default, the base URI is that of the current document. Not all
       HTML documents have a base URI (e.g., a valid HTML document may
       appear in an email and may not be designated by a URI). Such HTML
       documents are considered erroneous if they contain relative URIs
       and rely on a default base URI.

   Additionally, the OBJECT and APPLET elements define attributes that
   take precedence over the value set by the BASE element. Please consult
   the definitions of these elements for more information about URI issues
   specific to them.

   Note. For versions of HTTP that define a Link header, user agents
   should handle these headers exactly as LINK elements in the document.
   HTTP 1.1 as defined by [RFC2616] does not include a Link header field
   (refer to section 19.6.3).

   Glossary What is deep linking?

What is deep linking?

   Deep links are a type of link that send users directly to an app
   instead of a website or a store. They are used to send users straight
   to specific in-app locations, saving users the time and energy locating
   a particular page themselves – significantly improving the user
   experience.

   Deep linking does this by specifying a custom URL scheme (iOS Universal
   Links) or an intent URL (on Android devices) that opens your app if
   it’s already installed. Deep links can also be set to direct users to
   specific events or pages, which could tie into campaigns that you may
   want to run.

Why are deep links important?

   Deep links produce a seamless user journey that reduces churn and
   increases the likelihood of an install. They let you make sophisticated
   campaigns while providing a better user experience, moving users onto
   your app in a single click.

   Deep links also create the opportunity for easier incentivization. It’s
   simple to persuade people to try a new experience when a potential
   prize or offer is sent to them via a retargeting campaign. For example,
   let’s say you have a music app and want to promote a new album, so you
   allocate budget to be spent on a popular website. However, you want the
   user to listen to the sample in-app, not just on the website (where
   they are only exposed to the album cover). Here you need a deep link to
   send them directly to the correct page in your app, offering a seamless
   user experience.

   In-app deep linking can significantly increase your conversion rate and
   retention rate. Deep linking campaigns can be tracked, and provide
   extra data points on how your campaign performs. If you’d like to learn
   more about this, you can read up on the effects of deep linking in
   campaigns here.

What are deferred deep links?

   Deep links are a smart way to drive conversions while offering a
   positive user experience, but what happens if the user is deep linked
   into an app they don’t have installed? This is when deferred deep links
   come in to play.

   If a user clicks on a deep link and doesn’t have the app installed,
   they can be deferred to the App Store instead. The genius of deferred
   deep linking is that when that user installs and opens up the app, they
   can still be sent to the in-app location where you initially wanted
   them to land. For example, this could be a specific level in your
   gaming app, or a page from your product catalog for e-commerce.

Deep linking and Adjust

   Deep linking may seem like a challenge, but Adjust can help take care
   of them. You can create deep links, deploy them, and track the results
   in our dashboard, an additional but essential feature.

Adjust Deeplink Generator

   Adjust made the Deeplink Generator with usability in mind, allowing you
   to create a deep link without any extra effort. The Deeplink Generator
   provides marketers with fully-formed deep link URLs that work for both
   App Links (Android) and Universal Links (iOS), greatly reducing the
   hassle of implementing deep links yourself.

   To use the tool, log in to your Adjust dashboard and open the Menu,
   where you’ll see the ‘Deeplink Generator’ as an option. Click to open,
   and you’ll find a page to input the information required to create your
   deep link. Then simply copy and paste into whichever campaign you’ve
   set up.

   Have more questions on deep linking? We can help with our full deep
   linking guide, which covers the process and best practices. You can
   also read more about deep links with our official documentation, which
   shares detailed technical information on how our deep links work.

   What is a link?

   It is a connection from one web resource to another. A link has two
   ends, An anchor and direction. The link starts at the “source” anchor
   and points to the “destination” anchor, which may be any Web resource
   such as an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an HTML
   document or an element within an HTML document. You will find many
   websites or social media platforms ( Like YouTube, and Instagram )
   which link an image to a URL or a text to a URL etc.

   This basically means that by using the ‘a’ tag, you can link 1 element
   of the code to another element that may/may not be in your code.

   HTML Link Syntax

   Links are specified in HTML using the “a” tag.

   Syntax Explanation:
href : The href attribute is used to specify the destination address
       of the link used. "href" stands for Hypertext reference.
Text link : The text link is the visible part of the link.

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

   improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced
   material may be challenged and removed.

   (December 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)

   In computer science, link time refers to the period of time, during the
   creation of a computer program, in which a linker is being applied to
   that program.^[1]^[2]^[3] Link time occurs after compile time and
   before runtime (when a program is executed).

   It is common to speak of link time operations (the operations performed
   by a linker) or link time requirements (programming language
   requirements that must be met by compiled source code for it to be
   successfully linked).

Link time operations[edit]

   The operations performed at link time usually include fixing up the
   addresses of externally referenced objects and functions, various kinds
   of cross module checks (e.g. type checks on externally visible
   identifiers and in some languages instantiation of templates). Some
   optimizing compilers delay code generation until link time because it
   is here that information about a complete program is available to them.
   Resolving external variables in a program is also done at link time.

   The link-time optimization (LTO), when enabled, occurs at link time.

Link time requirements[edit]

   The definition of a programming language may specify link time
   requirements that source code must meet to be successfully compiled
   (e.g. the maximum number of characters in an externally visible
   identifier that must be considered significant).

Exceptions[edit]

   In some programming languages^[which?] it may be necessary for some
   compilation and linking to occur at runtime.

What is a Hyperlink? HTML Links Explained with Examples

   What is a Hyperlink? HTML Links Explained with Examples

   Let's begin with a quick question: How did you land on this article and
   this site today?

   Well, quite literally, by clicking or tapping on a link, right? That's
   how powerful this element is – it will get you to any part of the
   Internet just by clicking on a link.

   So, what are links and hyperlinks in HTML?

What are Links and Hyperlinks in HTML?

   A link is a chain that connects pages both within a website and to
   other websites. Without links, we wouldn't have any websites.

   For example, let's have a look at this URL,
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/. When you type it in the address bar it
   will take you to the official freeCodeCamp site.

   In simpler terms we can say that links are just the web addresses of
   web page that allow you to connect with different servers.

   Perhaps you are wondering, then, what a Hyperlink might be? Well, they
   are what allows us to link documents to other documents or resources
   via refrences called anchor tags. They are a fundamental concept behind
   the World Wide Web which makes navigation between web pages easier via
   links.

   Hyperlinks can be presented in different forms, like an image, icon,
   text, or any type of visible element that, when clicked, redirects you
   to a specified url.

   For example, if you were to click HERE, you will land in my profile
   with a list of my other articles. That's a hyperlink.

How to Create Links in HTML

How to use a links

   You can create a basic link by wrapping the text (or any other related
   content) in the a/a element and using the href attribute which
   contains the address.

   Here's an example in action:
a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"Visit: Freecode Camp!/a

How to style links

   There are usually links inserted in the .html file that link the main
   to the styling and funtionality file. And they're typically named with
   the .css and .js file extensions.

   Here's how to link to a CSS file:
!DOCTYPE html
html
head
  link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"
/head
body

h1This is a heading/h1
pThis is a paragraph./p

/body
/html

   And here's how to link to a JS file. You can either place what you want
   linked in the head or body tag.
!DOCTYPE html
html
head
  script src="myScript.js"/script
/head
body

h1This is a heading/h1
pThis is a paragraph./p

/body
/html

How to Link Within a Site

Links to different page within a Site

   You use this type of link to direct a user to different pages on the
   same site.

   Take a case where your site has 5 pages. You'll want a user to be able
   to access all the pages from one point, like the navbar.

   First you will have to create all the pages and then link them. In this
   case we will do it like this:
nav
    ul
        lia href="home.html"Home/a/li
        lia href="services.html"Services/a/li
        lia href="pricing.html"Pricing/a/li
        lia href="about.html"About/a/li
        lia href="contact.html"Contact/a/li
    /ul
/nav

   The above example will link to different parts of the site – the 'Home'
   page, 'Services', 'Pricing', and 'About', in that order. Writing only
   the name of the file is enough because all the work is shared in the
   same work folder.

How to Link to a specific section of a site

   Let's say that, somewhere on your site, you mentioned a particular
   topic or page. And you would like your readers or visitors to jump
   straight to that section with a click.

   First you will have to add the id attribute to that section of the
   page. Maybe it is a paragraph – if so, this is how it would look:
p id="detailed-info" Read more on Upcoming Events /p

   After this in your link add the id in the href:
a href="#detailed-info" Read more about upcoming events /a

   This code will take them right to the Upcoming Events section.

Other Types of Links in HTML

How to Link to a Downloadable file

   When you want to link to a resource that a user needs to download
   rather than open in the browser, you can use the download attribute.
   This provides a default save filename.

   The download attribute is great for PDFs, image files, video and audio
   clips, and other media content that you would like users to save on
   their computer or mobile device.

   Here's an example with a download link:
a href="https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-sslos=win64lang=
en-US"
   download="firefox-latest-64bit-installer.exe"
  Download Latest Firefox for Windows (64-bit) (English, US)
/a

How to Add E-mail Links

   Email Links allow us to create hyperlinks to an email address. You can
   create these links using the HTML a/a tag – but in this case,
   instead of passing a URL, we pass the recipient’s email address.

   You use the mailto attribute to specify the email address in your
   anchor tag.

   for example:
a href="mailto:hillarynyk@gmail.com"Send email to Me/a

   In addition to the email address, you can provide other information. In
   fact, any standard mail header fields can be added to the mailto URL
   you provide. The most commonly used are "subject", "cc", and "body".

   Here's an example that includes a cc, bcc, subject, and body:
a href="mailto:hillarynyk@gmail.com?cc=larymak4@gmail.combcc=larymak8@gmail.co
msubject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20emailbody=The%20body%20of%20the%20email"
  Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
/a

HTML Link Attributes

   HTML links have various attributes that you can use to provide more
   speicifc information. Here are some of the most commonly used.
    1. href attribute
       The href attribute defines the target URL address for an HTML link.
       It makes the marked word or phrase clickable. The href attribute
       creates a hyperlink to another web page, and HTML links would not
       work as intended without it.
    2. target attribute
       The target attribute defines where the HTML link will be opened.
       Ever visited a website and when you click on a link it
       automatically opens in a new tab? Well that's the work of this
       attribute.

   Here are all the possible options you can use with the target
   attribute:
     * -blank = Opens the link in a new tab. Mostly used to avoid losing
       a site's visitors. By default, when a user clicks a link it opens
       in the same tab – but this changes that.

a href= "https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" freeCodeCamp/a

     * _self = Loads the URL in the same window or the tab where it was
       clicked. This is usually the default and does not need to be
       specified.

a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_self"freeCodeCamp/a

     * _parent = Loads the URL in the parent frame. It’s only used with
       frames.

a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_parent"freeCodeCamp/a

     * _top = Loads the linked document in the full body of the window.

a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_top"freeCodeCamp/a

    3. title attribute
       The title attribute outlines extra information about the link’s
       purpose. If a user hovers their mouse over the link, a tooltip will
       appear which describes the objective, title, or any other
       information about the link:

a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" title="Link to free learning Resources"L
earn to code/a

Quick HTML Link Tips and Recap

   In this article, we learned all about links and hyperlinks in HTML.
   Here are some final tips to help you work with links.

   Firt, when you're using an image as a link, it's always a good idea to
   include the alt tag with the text. This provides alternative text
   that's displayed in case the picture doesn't load.

   Second, you should practise specifying the language of the document
   which the anchor is linked to using the hreflang attribute.
a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" hreflang="en"Freecode Camp/a

   The Web is really just a library of hyperlinked documents where the
   anchor tags act as bridges between related documents.

   We have seen how to use links and how to create them, and why they are
   important in web development.

   It's time to go practise and perfect your new skill.

   If you’re here is because you want to understand how links work, but
   before we understand it we must know how certain things work because it
   is an environment variable and how it differs from the other type of
   variables, also how the PAHT variable works, which has to do with the
   links in a script and that means the ASCII text within the text and how
   we make bash read it, well, actually there are many things.

   ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:
   The environment variable is the one that comes by default and
   predefined internally in the operating system or language, if we modify
   them we can change different aspects of the operating system that we
   have or environment that we are.

   LOCAL VARIABLE:
   The local variable is one that is created by the programmer, using a
   programming language or operating system.
   PAHT:
   It is an environment variable that saves the command paths, which are
   also environment variables, and because of this PAHT is the most
   important environment variable, if we change a small portion of the
   command path it stops working, PAHT saves the paths of “pwd , ls, mkdir
   “and many more, in other words, PHAT saves the LINKS of these commands
   inside an executable file.

   RELATIVE ROUTE:
   A relative path refers to a location that is relative to a current
   directory. In other words, its relationship to a file or directory
   depends on where the user is located. The closer the user is to the
   file and directory, the more relative it is. Relative paths use two
   special symbols, a dot (.) and a colon (..), which means the current
   directory and the parent directory. A colon in a row is used to move up
   in the hierarchy. A single point represents the current directory.

   ABSOLUTE PATH :
   Absolute paths indicate the location of a file or directory from the
   root directory of the file system. That is, to move from the source,
   that is, the root directory, to where we want to go.

   SCRIPT:
   A script in LINUX is a file that contains different commands that are
   interpreted by the shell to execute them by means of its path or rather
   its LINK. The shell executes them as if it had written them in PROMPT.
   When we write a SCRIPT in a file we do it through a LINK called SHEBANG
   which gives the BASH path to read the script.

   ASCII:
   ASCII code is a digitalization of human language to computer language,
   that is, it replaces letters with numbers which are interpreted by
   machines in a bit manner.

   I mention all this as a basis for understanding the links and their
   logical relationship of its operation, so let’s talk about links.

TO WHAT YOU HAVE COME TO!

   LINKS:
   The serves us to access the folders or files in a much simpler way,
   without the need to move through the entire HIERARCHY of the directory,
   through the RELATIVE ROUTE and the command cd we go from directory to
   directory until we stop where you want, but if instead we create a link
   to go directly where we want, it would be less time and much easier
   those are the links, it makes our life easier and they are everywhere,
   there are some that come predefined and are in the environment variable
   PAHT others to communicate or read directly as SHEBANG that places BASH
   to read the file.

   In Linux a link can be physical or symbolic:

   PHYSICAL LINK
   Physical links can only be created for files and not for directories,
   the PHYSICAL LINK is the name given to a file in another location which
   contains the path or information that is put to it.
   example:

   create a link from the current location;

   PROMPT ~$: home/ holbertonschool-low_level_programming

   WE CREATE A FILE ~$: emacs bettyCool

   WE CREATE THE LINK ~$: ln bettyCool holberton

   We put “ls” to see the content~$: ls; holberton

   There are two files, this means that if I enter holberton it will show
   me what has bettyCool, since both have the same content. And a
   characteristic of the PHYSICAL LINKS is that if you delete one of the
   two the other still exists without any problem.

   SYMBOLIC LINKS

   The symbolic links have the same function as a physical but the
   difference is that it does not contain the data of the file, instead it
   points to that folder or to the registry where the data is located. In
   other words it is like a shortcut in Windows that when I click it takes
   me to where the content I need, it would be like a kind of hyperlink of
   a web page. If the destination file is deleted the symbolic link will
   be unusable, because it will not be able to refer to the file it was
   pointing to, since it is not there.

   Symbolic links have the same syntax as the physical one but with a
   small only that we add the option -s to indicate that we want to make a
   symbolic link.
   Example:

   In the download folder you have an absolute path from where the file
   was downloaded;

   PROMPT ~$ : cd/home/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/

   PROMPT ~$ : ls/home/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/

   we have files ~$: bettyCool
   We create the symbolic link from the current path and we create a new
   home file called ENIAC that points to the bettyCool path.

   Now we see that after creating the symbolic link we go to the home
   folder and with “ls -l” we will see that ENIAC points to the ROUTE of
   bettyCool, and if we enter ENIAC it shows me the content of bettyCool,
   this would be the same and practically a C pointer.

When you open files or directories very repeatedly, links are your best tool
to shorten time and eliminate headaches,
use them as you will look very professional in doing so.
Thank you and I hope this information helps you with Linux.

   Have you ever been familiar with something, worked around it, but not
   fully understood its concepts? I feel like that happens to me more than
   most people. This is a frustrating feeling, but it is also one that
   often is easily remedied. Sometimes, it only takes someone explaining
   the concept in "plain English," aka layman's terms. That is the goal of
   this article. I want to talk about hard links and soft (symbolic) links
   in the most basic terms possible. You may realize that this concept,
   which is often a struggle for sysadmins, is quite simple. If nothing
   else, I take you through the syntax to create these links (which many
   people find difficult to remember). So let's get down to it.

Hard links

   The concept of a hard link is the most basic we will discuss today.
   Every file on the Linux filesystem starts with a single hard link. The
   link is between the filename and the actual data stored on the
   filesystem. Creating an additional hard link to a file means a few
   different things. Let's discuss these.

   First, you create a new filename pointing to the exact same data as the
   old filename. This means that the two filenames, though different,
   point to identical data. For example, if I create file
   /home/tcarrigan/demo/link_test and write hello world in the file, I
   have a single hard link between the file name link_test and the file
   content hello world.
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-rw-r--. 1 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 link_test

   Take note of the link count here (1).

   Next, I create a new hard link in /tmp to the exact same file using the
   following command:
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ln link_test /tmp/link_new

   The syntax is ln (original file path) (new file path).

   Now when I look at my filesystem, I see both hard links.
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ls -l link_test /tmp/link_new
-rw-rw-r--. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 link_test
-rw-rw-r--. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 /tmp/link_new

   The primary difference here is the filename. The link count has also
   been changed (2). Most notably, if I cat the new file's contents, it
   displays the original data.
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ cat /tmp/link_new
hello world

   When changes are made to one filename, the other reflects those
   changes. The permissions, link count, ownership, timestamps, and file
   content are the exact same. If the original file is deleted, the data
   still exists under the secondary hard link. The data is only removed
   from your drive when all links to the data have been removed. If you
   find two files with identical properties but are unsure if they are
   hard-linked, use the ls -i command to view the inode number. Files that
   are hard-linked together share the same inode number.
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ls -li link_test /tmp/link_new
2730074 -rw-rw-r--. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 link_test
2730074 -rw-rw-r--. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 /tmp/link_new

   The shared inode number is 2730074, meaning these files are identical
   data.

   If you want more information on inodes, read my full article here.

Hard limits

   While useful, there are some limitations to what hard links can do. For
   starters, they can only be created for regular files (not directories
   or special files). Also, a hard link cannot span multiple filesystems.
   They only work when the new hard link exists on the same filesystem as
   the original.

Soft links

   Commonly referred to as symbolic links, soft links link together
   non-regular and regular files. They can also span multiple filesystems.
   By definition, a soft link is not a standard file, but a special file
   that points to an existing file. Let's look at how to create a soft
   link. I use the ln -s command and the following syntax:

   ln -s (file path you want to point to) (new file path)

   In the example below, I create a new file at
   /home/tcarrigan/demo/soft_link_test with the file content soft Hello
   world. I then create a soft link to that file at /tmp/soft_link_new:
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ln -s /home/tcarrigan/demo/soft_link_test /tmp/soft_lin
k_new
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ls -l soft_link_test /tmp/soft_link_new
-rw-rw-r--. 1 tcarrigan tcarrigan 17 Aug 30 11:59 soft_link_test
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 tcarrigan tcarrigan 35 Aug 30 12:09 /tmp/soft_link_new - /home/tc
arrigan/demo/soft_link_test

   Notice that /tmp/soft_link_new is just a symbolic link, pointing to the
   original /home/tcarrigan/demo/soft_link_test. If I cat the content of
   /tmp/soft_link_new, I should see the soft Hello world text.
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ cat /tmp/soft_link_new
soft Hello world

   All of this sounds great, but there are some drawbacks to using a soft
   link. The biggest concern is data loss and data confusion. If the
   original file is deleted, the soft link is broken. This situation is
   referred to as a dangling soft link. If you were to create a new file
   with the same name as the original, your dangling soft link is no
   longer dangling at all. It points to the new file created, whether this
   was your intention or not, so be sure to keep this in mind.

Hard or soft?

   There is no clear answer here. The best link is the type that fits your
   particular situation. While these concepts can be tricky to remember,
   the syntax is pretty straightforward, so that is a plus! To keep the
   two easily separated in your mind, I leave you with this:
     * A hard link always points a filename to data on a storage device.
     * A soft link always points a filename to another filename, which
       then points to information on a storage device.

   Hopefully, this helps you keep them separated as you work your way
   through the link types needed to accomplish your daily goals!

What are link aggregation and LACP and how can I use them in my network?

What is link aggregation?

   Link aggregation allows you to combine multiple Ethernet links into a
   single logical link between two networked devices.

   Link aggregation is sometimes called by other names:
     * Ethernet bonding
     * Ethernet teaming
     * Link bonding
     * Link bundling
     * Link teaming
     * Network interface controller (NIC) bonding
     * NIC teaming
     * Port aggregation
     * Port channeling
     * Port trunking

   The most common device combinations involve connecting a switch to
   another switch, a server, a network attached storage (NAS) device, or a
   multi-port access point.

   Network devices and management functions treat the link aggregation
   group (LAG) of multiple Ethernet connections as a single link. For
   example, you can include a LAG in a virtual local area network (VLAN).
   You can also configure more than one LAG on the same switch, or add
   more than two Ethernet links to the same LAG (the maximum number of
   links per LAG depends on your device).

   Some network devices support Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP),
   which helps to prevent errors in the link aggregation setup process.

   Unmanaged switches do not support link aggregation.


What are the benefits of link aggregation?

   Link aggregation offers the following benefits:
     * Increased reliability and availability. If one of the physical
       links in the LAG goes down, traffic is dynamically and
       transparently reassigned to one of the other physical links.
     * Better use of physical resources. Traffic can be load-balanced
       across the physical links.
     * Increased bandwidth. The aggregated physical links deliver higher
       bandwidth than each individual link.
     * Cost effectiveness. A physical network upgrade can be expensive,
       especially if it requires new cable runs. Link aggregation
       increases bandwidth without requiring new equipment.


What are the different types of LAGs?

   The two primary types of LAGs are static (also known as manual) and
   dynamic. Dynamic LAGs use Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to
   negotiate settings between the two connected devices.

   Some devices support static LAGs, but do not support dynamic LAGs with
   LACP. Refer to your product’s user manual to see whether your device
   supports LACP.

   Linux-based devices, such as NETGEAR ReadyNAS storage devices, often
   offer several additional types of link aggregation that provide
   increased fault tolerance or load balancing instead of increased
   bandwidth.


What is Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)?

   Link Aggregation Control Protocol is an IEEE standard defined in IEEE
   802.3ad. LACP lets devices send Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data
   Units (LACPDUs) to each other to establish a link aggregation
   connection. You still need to configure the LAG on each device, but
   LACP helps prevent one of the most common problems that can occur
   during the process of setting up link aggregation: misconfigured LAG
   settings. If the devices detect that they cannot establish a link
   aggregation connection, they do not try to establish it, and the link
   shows as “down” in the admin interface.

   Another useful feature of LACP is that when one member link stops
   sending LACPDUs (if the cable is unplugged, for example), it is removed
   from the LAG. This helps to minimize packet loss.

   Both devices must support LACP for you to set up a dynamic LAG between
   those devices. We recommend using LACP instead of a static LAG whenever
   both devices support LACP.


How do I set up link aggregation in my network?

   The following instructions describe in general terms how to set up link
   aggregation between two devices in your network. For more information
   about setting up link aggregation on specific NETGEAR devices, see the
   NETGEAR product support page for your product. To find your product’s
   support page, visit https://www.netgear.com/support/ and enter your
   product model number in the search box.

   To set up link aggregation between two devices in your network:
    1. Make sure that both devices support link aggregation.
    2. Configure the LAG on each of the two devices.
    3. Make sure that the LAG that you create on each device has the same
       settings for port speed, duplex mode, flow control, and MTU size
       (on some devices, this setting might be called jumbo frames).
    4. Make sure that all ports that are members of a LAG have the same
       virtual local area network (VLAN) memberships.
       If you want to add a LAG to a VLAN, set up the LAG first and then
       add the LAG to the VLAN; do not add individual ports.

   Do not connect the devices to each other using more than one Ethernet
   cable until after you set up the LAG on each device. If you form
   multiple connections between the two devices and neither device has
   loop prevention, you create a network loop. Network loops can slow or
   stop normal traffic on your network.
    5. Note which ports on each device you add to the LAG, and make sure
       that you connect the correct ones.
       The LAG issues an alert and rejects the configuration if port
       members have different settings for port speed, duplex mode, or MTU
       size, or if you accidentally connect ports that are not members of
       the LAG.
    6. Use Ethernet or fiber cable to connect the ports that you added to
       the LAG on each device.
    7. Verify that the port LED for each connected port on each NETGEAR
       switch is blinking green.
    8. Verify in the admin interface for each device that the link is UP.

Everything You Need To Know About ‘App Links’: The Mobile App URLs Equivalent
Of Website URLs

   Updated on October 24, 2017
   Everything You Need To Know About App Links

   Mobile App Links are a type of mobile URLs. They make it possible to
   link to specific pages or screens of an app. They also allow you to
   link your website pages to the respective screens in your app.

What do App Links do?


    They close the loop between the creation of content, its discovery
    and app downloads by creating unique links for different pages or
    screens of an app. Thus, App Links allow users to click links to view
    content directly in the app (if already downloaded), or download the
    app to view content present on any particular screen of the app.

Is it possible to type them like URLs in the address bar?

   Nopes, you can only share the mobile App URLs with others. Since there
   is no such thing as an address bar for apps, it is not possible to type
   App Links in the address bar.

What theory is App Links based on?

   App Links is based on the principle of ‘Deep-linking‘, which involve
   linking to specific screens (pages) within apps and launching mobile
   apps via links.

Which platforms do App Links support?

   App url deeplinks is cross platform

   App Links are cross-platform and currently support iOS, Android and
   Windows Phones. However, they can also be extended to support other
   platforms.

Are App Links free?

   App Links are open source, so you can use them without paying for it.
   You can also change them to suit any platform or environment.

How do they work?

   They let you link from an app to specific screens within the same or a
   different app. In short, they work like URLs for websites.

   How App Links work

Example 1 – Linking to a screen in the same app

   If I have opened a Facebook page on my Facebook app, and if I want to
   share a link of that page (without visiting the Facebook website) from
   the app with my friend, then I will use its URL (App Link) and share it
   with my friend using the messages or chat window.

Example 2 – Linking to a screen in a different app

   Pinterest mobile app linked from Facebook app using App Links

Linking Pinterest app from inside of a Facebook app

   Provided that some conditions are satisfied, you can link to a tweet in
   Twitter app from your Facebook app using App Links . The requirements
   are that both Facebook and Twitter need to have App Links enabled. Now,
   Facebook app has built-in App Links functionality, but Twitter has a
   different set of deeplinks as part of its feature called Twitter Cards.
   Since, not both the apps have App Links, it is not possible to link
   them.

   However, you can link an app like Pinterest (which supports App Links)
   with Facebook app. All you have to do is to go to a screen in
   Pinterest, copy the App Link (or URI), then open your Facebook app and
   paste it in your status update. Your friends who click on the link on a
   desktop will be shown download links for Pinterest app for platforms
   like iOS, Android or Windows Phone; however, they won’t being able to
   download the Pinterest app on their laptop. The friends who click on
   the link through a mobile device, will be directed to the image URL
   (regardless of the mobile platform) if they have the Pinterest app
   installed; if they don’t have the Pinterest app, they will be directed
   to the download link for that particular platform, clicking on which
   would take them to the image URL.

What is the minimum requirement for App Links to work?

   For App Links to work, the linking and the linked apps should have App
   Links enabled.

How to enable App Links for an app?

   App Links can be enabled for an app by defining customized Universal
   Resource Identifiers (URIs) for that app and adding specific tags in
   the codes of that app.

What are the different types of App links in the market?

   App Links is a name of a certain type of deeplinks which have been
   instituted by AppLinks.org. Some other companies have also developed
   links for apps, with a different set of features compared to App Links.
   They are as follows:

Cellogic Ltd’s Deeplink

   The Deeplink.me services help in making your app pages linkable through
   deeplinks,  just like App Links. The links build using deeplink.me
   function for app pages of an app on all platforms. They also offer
   translation rules for customized URIs, user engagement analytics, link
   fallbacks in the case of an emergency/failure and Twitter Card (see
   below) support. Apart from that, deeplink.me services support
   retargeting in apps that help you retain customers and increase sales.
   It also offers features that facilitate app discovery by search engine
   spiders.


    While Deeplink.me offers a range of features with improved
    functionality, what sets it apart is that no SDKs are required to set
    up deeplinks for an app. All that need to be done is set an app up in
    Deeplink.me portal and the app pages get deeplinked with
    URIs.Deeplink.me is a paid service, since it involves extensive use
    of their app portal. The major companies that have implemented
    deeplinks offered by Cellogic Ltd are JackThreads, ThreadFlip and
    Shazam.

    Deeplinks are paid, like most other marketing-oriented services.

Google Search Results Indexed App Deeplinks


    Google Search Results Indexed App Deeplinks
    Google indexes apps, if an app is enabled with Google App Indexing
    API. What it means is, Google can display results that include
    specific pages of an app, each with distinct URIs. So, users who
    perform searches on their smartphones get search results also from
    mobile apps, instead of just websites.

Deeplinks of different apps indexed by Google and listed in the search
results


    Eg. If you search for ‘heaters’ on Google, then search results will
    include a list of heaters retrieved from eBay app, replete with
    ratings, reviews, information and the URI to the particular screen
    within the eBay app.
    Enabling Google Search Results App Deeplinks is a three-step process.
    First you have to implement deeplinks in your app. Second step
    involves connecting your website with your app, and the third step
    involves verifying your website with Google. This service is only
    available for Android app development right now.

Tapstream’s Deferred Links


    Links to a specific screen or a landing within an app through URIs,
    text ads or image ads. Clicking on the link or the ad takes users to
    the destination screen within the app. It does this in two ways

    1. If the user has the destination app installed, it directly takes
       him to that particular screen, displaying a brief message during
       the redirect
    2. If the user does not have the destination app installed, it takes
       the users to the download page for that app for that platform, then
       as the app is getting installed it displays a message indicating
       that the user will be directed to the landing page.

   Tapstream’s Deferred Links are mainly for app marketing companies who
   intend to make use of Landing Pages within their apps to generate
   quality leads. The Deferred Links are paid, and have different price
   points.

Twitter’s App Cards

   Twitter’s App Cards
   One of the several different Twitter Cards, through App Cards you can
   tweet a link to any webpage on your website and Twitter will
   automatically display your tweet alongside an App Card. This App Card
   would show all the data regarding your app like screenshot, ratings,
   free or paid app, description and a link to its App Store depending on
   the mobile platform you prefer. For this to work, you should have the
   App Card enabled in your website and have specified your card type and
   app IDs for iOS and Android. Twitter App Card with detailed app
   information

whose download link was tweeted

   This App Card can also show links to specific pages within the app for
   the website, provided the app has deeplinking enabled.
   URX’s Omnilinks, Omnilinks.js and App Search
   Enabling Omnilinks and deeplink Analytics for an app

Prepending the URX code at the front of URI for an app enables Omnilinks and
Analytics

   URX has developed two separate approaches for deeplinking within apps.
   Omnilinks helps users to link to specifc pages within the same or a
   different app. This approach is especially useful if a user doesn’t
   have an app installed, in which case the user is directed to the
   download link for the app on the platform-specific app store. And, if
   the user already has an app installed, he is directly taken to the
   specific screen within the app. This facility is extremely useful to
   marketers who intend to increase their app downloads by directing
   people towards it through social media and other marketing channels.
   Linking from Gmail to Bleach Report Omnilinks

Linking from Gmail to the Bleacher Report app using Omnilinks

   The Omnilinks.js approach is only for deeplinking within apps that
   users have already downloaded. So, this approach doesn’t work for the
   apps that a user hasn’t downloaded. Omnilinks.js can be used for
   in-house staff usage for easy transitions from website to mobile app
   and vice versa.
   To create both these types of Omnilinks, no changes in the code are
   required. You just need to add ‘http://urx.io/’ before your URI to
   create omnilink.
   Requirement: For Omnilinks to work, an app must have deeplinks, without
   which the URX Omnilinks are to link between apps. Similarly, websites
   must have appropriate meta tags enabled to make it possible to link
   them to an app. URX’s Omnilinks support App Links tags, so if you App
   Links tags enabled, you just have to prepend the URX code to the URI.
   App Search: This feature allows apps to scour the content present on
   other apps and also link to the respective pages of that app.

Are all these different types of App Links (i.e deep links) cross-compatible?

   Unfortunately, only some of these compatible with each other (App Links
   and URX’s Omnilinks). The reason for that is, all the services are
   provided by different companies or organisation, and since no two
   services have been widely adopted by the masses yet, third-parties who
   can combine the features of the many services have yet to come up.

Why is there a dire need for App Links?

   Currently, the pages or screens of apps don’t have appended URIs the
   way websites have URLs. So, it is impossible to locate specific pages
   within an app or share those pages with others.

Which companies have adopted AppLinks?

   Facebook, a partner in the AppLinks initiative, has implemented them
   across most of its features. App Links currently supports News Feed,
   pages, status updates and links shared by apps. Top mobile apps like
   Mailbox, Quip, and Spotify also have deeply integrated AppLinks.
   Some major companies have recently made their content available for
   linking. They are: Pinterest, Redfin, Goodreads, Edomondo, Hulu,
   Flixter, Wattpad, Venmo, MovieTickets.com, Mixcloud, Rdio, SoundCloud,
   Tumblr, EyeEm, Houzz, Flickr, Vevo, Vimeo, Rhapsody, Fancy.com, iHeart,
   Songkick, and DailyMotion.

Why are App Links a good investment of your time and resources?

   App Links are slightly complicated, and might take some time to
   implement and a little more to perfect, but they give you so many other
   things in return.
   First of all, they help you drive your app downloads, regardless of the
   platform, if visitors happen to stumble across the app download link.
   This will, in turn, also lead to an increase in paid app or ad revenue
   from your mobile app.
   f the familiarity and convenience that App Links provide. This also
   increase the visibility of your app, which unlike your website, stays
   hidden from the eyes of people most of the times.
   Most importantly, since not many companies have implemented App Links,
   they will also lend your app or website a novel factor. So, people will
   keep coming back or download the app just to experience something new.

How do I start implementing App Links from scratch?

   If you are implementing App Links for the first time, then use Facebook
   SDK to deeplink your mobile app. Facebook has provided comprehensive
   documentation along with how-tos (with screenshots) on how to implement
   App Links as well as all the special features. Also, using Facebook SDK
   would help you leverage your website’s social media presence to
   increase downloads of your app and thus generate revenue.

What are some new or additional features of App Links?

   Analytics
   App Links have inbuilt functionality to measure and analyse how they
   are being used with apps. They can track the clicks, the landing pages,
   time, date, frequency and other data to give you a comprehensive lists
   and graphs of analytics. Using these analytics, you can optimize the
   integration of App Links into your app to enrich the experience of
   users or generate revenue from your app. To set up Analytics for App
   Links you have include lines of code on Bolts SDK, which is found in
   Facebook SDK. Since there is no SDK to support Bolts SDK except that of
   Facebook, this functionality is difficult to implement with other
   services.
   Launching Outbound Apps

   A feature similar to one designed by Tapstream for its ‘Deferred
   Links’, it allow users to click-through from an existing app to other
   apps. For example, if they click on an ad in one app, they will be
   taken to a landing page or screen on another app.

Issues, Problems, Worries and Difficulties:

     * The cross-platform compatibility of App Links also makes it a bit
       more complicated. There are three major mobile platforms (iOS,
       Android and Windows Phone) in the mobile app market. If you have
       the same app available on different platforms, you have to define
       platform-specific tags and make changes to code for each of your
       apps.
     * The transition from a website to an app or vice versa is not smooth
       and seamless because of the obvious differences between websites
       and apps. All the pages in a website cannot be linked to screen in
       an app, as app use much less real and are extremely simplistic in
       nature.
     * Linking to a screen from one app to a different app can also be
       really disruptive. For example, if I link from Facebook app to The
       Huffington Post and I used my Twitter account to log in to The
       Huffington Post, then I will be taken to the Twitter app first to
       login, after which I will redirected to The Huffington Post app. It
       is also possible that I might be directed to the download link for
       Twitter app even though it is already installed on my smartphone.
     * Most of the services listed here (excluding App Links) are not
       available to Windows Phone apps. So, there is still no way for App
       Links to deeplink to your Windows Phone app.

   PS: I have used ‘screen’ and ‘page’ interchangeably for an app. Both
   mean the same, a screen or a page within an app. Also, I have used App
   Links instead of the oft-used generic term for mobile app links i.e
   ‘deeplinks’ to make understanding this new concept simpler.

   Website linking style
   See also: Deeplink (company) and Mobile deep linking

   In the context of the World Wide Web, deep linking is the use of a
   hyperlink that links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed,
   piece of web content on a website (e.g.
   "https://example.com/path/page"), rather than the website's home page
   (e.g., "https://example.com"). The URL contains all the information
   needed to point to a particular item. Deep linking is different from
   mobile deep linking, which refers to directly linking to in-app content
   using a non-HTTP URI.

Deep linking and HTTP[edit]

   The technology behind the World Wide Web, the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP), does not actually make any distinction between "deep"
   links and any other links—all links are functionally equal. This is
   intentional; one of the design purposes of the Web is to allow authors
   to link to any published document on another site. The possibility of
   so-called "deep" linking is therefore built into the Web technology of
   HTTP and URLs by default—while a site can attempt to restrict deep
   links, to do so requires extra effort. According to the World Wide Web
   Consortium Technical Architecture Group, "any attempt to forbid the
   practice of deep linking is based on a misunderstanding of the
   technology, and threatens to undermine the functioning of the Web as a
   whole".^[1]

Usage[edit]

   Some commercial websites object to other sites making deep links into
   their content either because it bypasses advertising on their main
   pages, passes off their content as that of the linker or, like The Wall
   Street Journal, they charge users for permanently valid links.
   Sometimes, deep linking has led to legal action such as in the 1997
   case of Ticketmaster versus Microsoft, where Microsoft deep-linked to
   Ticketmaster's site from its Sidewalk service. This case was settled
   when Microsoft and Ticketmaster arranged a licensing agreement.
   Ticketmaster later filed a similar case against Tickets.com, and the
   judge in this case ruled that such linking was legal as long as it was
   clear to whom the linked pages belonged.^[2] The court also concluded
   that URLs themselves were not copyrightable, writing: "A URL is simply
   an address, open to the public, like the street address of a building,
   which, if known, can enable the user to reach the building. There is
   nothing sufficiently original to make the URL a copyrightable item,
   especially the way it is used. There appear to be no cases holding the
   URLs to be subject to copyright. On principle, they should not be."

Deep linking and web technologies[edit]

   Websites built on technologies such as Adobe Flash and AJAX often do
   not support deep linking. This can cause usability problems for
   visitors to those sites. For example, they may be unable to save
   bookmarks to individual pages or states of the site, use the web
   browser forward and back buttons—and clicking the browser refresh
   button may return the user to the initial page.

   However, this is not a fundamental limitation of these technologies.
   Well-known techniques, and libraries such as SWFAddress^[3] and unFocus
   History Keeper,^[4] now exist that website creators using Flash or AJAX
   can use to provide deep linking to pages within their
   sites.^[5]^[6]^[7]

Court rulings[edit]

   Probably the earliest legal case arising out of deep linking was the
   1996 Scottish case of The Shetland Times vs. The Shetland News, in
   which the Times accused the News of appropriating stories on the Times'
   website as its own.^[8]^[9]

   At the beginning of 2006, in a case between the search engine Bixee.com
   and job site Naukri.com, the Delhi High Court in India prohibited
   Bixee.com from deep linking to Naukri.com.^[10]

   The most important and widely cited U.S. opinions on deep linking are
   the Ninth Circuit's rulings in Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.^[11] and
   Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc..^[12] In both cases, the court
   exonerated the use of deep linking. In the second of these cases, the
   court explained (speaking of defendant Google, whom Perfect 10 had also
   sued) why linking is not a copyright infringement under US law:

     Google does not…display a copy of full-size infringing photographic
     images for purposes of the Copyright Act when Google frames in-line
     linked images that appear on a user's computer screen. Because
     Google's computers do not store the photographic images, Google does
     not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act. In
     other words, Google does not have any "material objects…in which a
     work is fixed…and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced,
     or otherwise communicated" and thus cannot communicate a copy.
     Instead of communicating a copy of the image, Google provides HTML
     instructions that direct a user's browser to a website publisher's
     computer that stores the full-size photographic image. Providing
     these HTML instructions is not equivalent to showing a copy. First,
     the HTML instructions are lines of text, not a photographic image.
     Second, HTML instructions do not themselves cause infringing images
     to appear on the user's computer screen. The HTML merely gives the
     address of the image to the user's browser. The browser then
     interacts with the computer that stores the infringing image. It is
     this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the
     user's computer screen. Google may facilitate the user's access to
     infringing images. However, such assistance raised only contributory
     liability issues and does not constitute direct infringement of the
     copyright owner's display rights. …While in-line linking and framing
     may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single
     Google webpage, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does
     not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer
     confusion.

   In December 2006, a Texas court ruled that linking by a motocross
   website to videos on a Texas-based motocross video production website
   did not constitute fair use. The court subsequently issued an
   injunction.^[13] This case, SFX Motor Sports Inc., v. Davis, was not
   published in official reports, but is available at 2006 WL 3616983.

   In a February 2006 ruling, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court
   (Copenhagen) found systematic crawling, indexing and deep linking by
   portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk not to conflict with
   Danish law or the database directive of the European Union. The Court
   stated that search engines are desirable for the functioning of the
   Internet, and that, when publishing information on the Internet, one
   must assume—and accept—that search engines deep-link to individual
   pages of one's website.^[14]

Legend[edit]

   Web site owners who don't want search engines to deep link, or want
   them only to index specific pages can request so using the Robots
   Exclusion Standard (robots.txt file). People who favor deep linking
   often feel that content owners who don't provide a robots.txt file are
   implying by default that they do not object to deep linking either by
   search engines or others.^[citation needed] People against deep linking
   often claim that content owners may be unaware of the Robots Exclusion
   Standard or may not use robots.txt for other reasons.^[citation needed]
   Sites other than search engines can also deep link to content on other
   sites, so some question the relevance of the Robots Exclusion Standard
   to controversies about Deep Linking.^[15] The Robots Exclusion Standard
   does not programmatically enforce its directives so it does not prevent
   search engines and others who do not follow polite conventions from
   deep linking.^[16]

   When you think of stress, it probably brings negative emotions to mind.
   But some stress is good for you, like the anticipation you feel when
   you start a new relationship or job. It can fuel excitement and make
   you want to do and achieve more. Stress can also help you be prepared
   to face challenges or respond to dangerous situations.

   Good stress doesn’t stick around. It boosts your mood to meet the
   moment, then goes away. If you’re under stress for long periods of
   time, it can become overwhelming and affect you both physically and
   emotionally.

   “Our stress response does pretty good in the short term, but it doesn’t
   do very good if you activate it in the long term,” says David Prescott,
   PhD, associate professor of Health Administration and Public Health at
   Husson University in Bangor, ME.

   “If we stay under chronic stress, our physiological stress response is
   taxed beyond what it’s designed to do, and it starts to impair us.”

   The effects of chronic, or long-term, stress can be harmful on their
   own, but they also can contribute to depression, a mood disorder that
   makes you feel sad and disinterested in things you usually enjoy.
   Depression can affect your appetite, your sleep habits, and your
   ability to concentrate.

   And the effects of depression can cause stress.

   “The impact of stress on depression, and vice versa, is one of the most
   important problems of our times,” says Carol Landau, PhD, clinical
   professor at Brown University.

The Stress-Depression Connection

   “We think that the causal relationship between stress and depression is
   what’s called ‘bidirectional,’” Prescott says. “One can cause the
   other, and the other can cause the first, and both can make each other
   worse.”

   The ways depression can lead to stress are pretty clear.

   “Depression disrupts your life, so you often are more isolated,”
   Prescott says. “Sometimes you shrink your interpersonal network and
   stop doing a lot of activities, like work or school or things that you
   enjoy. We know that kind of isolation makes your perceived stress level
   go up, so we know that depression can cause stress.”

   There’s good evidence that the reverse is true as well.

   “A severe stress, like a divorce or a huge financial change, is a major
   stressor, and it sends the psyche sort of out of equilibrium. If you
   keep raising levels of stress, something’s going to happen, and often
   it is depression,” Landau says.

   But the reasons stress contributes to depression are less obvious.

   “It’s pretty clear that chronic stress raises the incidence level of
   depression,” Prescott says. According to The Mental Health Survey
   Report from The Mental Health Institution, levels of depression among
   members of Gen Z went up about 4% or 5% between pre- and post-pandemic.

   “We think the social isolation, the disruption in normal activities,
   and the general stress of having your college or work disrupted
   appeared to increase levels of depression. But I would say we don’t
   know, causally, exactly how that happened.”

Make Lifestyle Changes

   Sometimes a few small changes can break the stress-depression cycle,
   beginning with a more positive mindset.

   “If you’re stressed and feel like you’re starting to become depressed,
   the biggest thing is to get a little more active coping strategy in the
   way you’re going to deal with your stress,” Prescott says. “Don’t just
   think that you’re going to have to ‘suck it up and take it.’"

   A more active coping strategy can include:
     * Exercise. Just 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days a week is
       enough to make a difference. Activities like yoga and tai chi,
       which slow things down and help you relax, are good for reducing
       stress.
     * Avoid binge-eating or drinking. These may make you feel better
       temporarily, but they’re not helpful. In addition to being
       physically harmful, they can make you feel guilty and worse about
       yourself. Overdoing alcohol can affect your sleep and make you
       sluggish the next day.
     * Limit caffeine. Too much can wind you up and make stress even more
       intense. Try to cut down on coffee, soda, and other caffeinated
       drinks.
     * Quit smoking. The idea that smoking cigarettes can help you handle
       stress is a popular myth. While nicotine does help relax you right
       away, that feeling is short-lived and can create more stress
       through cravings or withdrawal.
     * Make time for yourself. Do things you like to do or that make you
       feel good. Go easy on yourself and focus on the things you do well.
     * Steer clear of stressors. If you know something or someone sets you
       off, do what you can to avoid that situation or person.
     * Sleep well. Making sure your mind and body get enough rest can go a
       long way toward easing stress. The National Sleep Foundation
       recommends 7 to 9 hours for adults every night.

   “If you’re depressed and you’re trying to minimize the impact of stress
   on your life, it’s important to overcome that belief that ‘nothing I do
   is really going to matter,’” Prescott says. “It’s just not true in most
   cases. It may not change everything, but it’s a big thing to overcome
   that kind of hopeless belief.”

Find Support

   Another way to ease the effects of stress and depression is to not try
   to handle them alone. Strong, supportive relationships can make a big
   difference.

   “Depression is a state of disconnection,” Landau says. “So one of the
   most important things would be to find a way to connect. Adding a
   couple of people who you’ve known from the past and finding a way to
   connect is extremely important.”

   Talking with friends and family can help you better understand what’s
   causing your stress, which can be a big step forward.

   “If stress and depression are playing off each other, it can help to
   kind of articulate and pinpoint the stressors in your life that are
   causing the most impairment,” Prescott says. “We ultimately all feel
   ‘I’m stressed,’ in general, but it’s really helpful to sort of pinpoint
   down what specific things are getting to you.

   “It’s helpful to have someone say things like, ‘How are you doing
   dealing with your stress?’ or ‘Tell me about how your mood is holding
   up?’ or ‘How are your spirits?’ Then just listen.

   “A lot of times, what helps people is not specific advice like, ‘Do
   this or do that,’ but just a chance to talk it out with somebody who
   pays attention. Ask an open-ended question like that and then bite your
   bottom lip and listen for a while.”

   If talking to friends or family doesn’t work well enough, you can talk
   with a professional. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one way to
   change your perspective and approach.

   “Cognitive behavior therapy is important because we want to be able to
   get control back,” Landau says. “CBT helps you focus on what small
   thing you can accomplish today, how you can implement it, how you can
   evaluate it. So it’s a great educational tool as well as a therapy
   tool.”

Abstract

   The authors investigated the development of the affective, cognitive,
   and behavioral components of empathy in preschoolers, specifically
   examining how cognitive empathy is linked to theory of mind and
   affective perspective taking. Participants were 158 children aged 4-6
   years. They listened to narratives and then answered questions about
   the protagonists' emotions. The affective component was probed with the
   question, "How do you feel seeing the little girl/boy?"; the cognitive
   component with the question, "Why do you feel [emotion shared with the
   character]?"; and the behavioral one with the question, "What would you
   do if you were next to the little boy/girl [experiencing an emotional
   scenario]?" Results revealed a developmental sequence in the
   self-focused attribution of cognitive empathy, and a trend toward a
   developmental sequence for behavioral empathy, which underwent a slight
   linear increase between 4 and 6 years old. Affective empathy remained
   stable. More interestingly, they showed that cognitive empathy is
   linked to both theory of mind and affective perspective taking.

   Keywords: children; empathy; theory of mind.

Abstract

   Theorists have long assumed that people's self-esteem and social
   relationships influence each other. However, the empirical evidence has
   been inconsistent, creating substantial uncertainty about whether
   relationships are in fact an influential factor in self-esteem
   development and vice versa. This meta-analysis synthesizes the
   available longitudinal data on the prospective effect of social
   relationships on self-esteem (48 samples including 46,231 participants)
   and the prospective effect of self-esteem on social relationships (35
   samples including 21,995 participants). All effects controlled for
   prior levels of the outcomes. Results showed that relationships and
   self-esteem reciprocally predict each other over time with similar
   effect sizes (β = .08 in both directions). Moderator analyses suggested
   that the effects held across sample characteristics such as mean age,
   gender, ethnicity, and time lag between assessments, except for the
   self-esteem effect on relationships, which was moderated by type of
   relationship partner (stronger for general relationships than for
   specific partners) and relationship reporter (stronger for
   self-reported than for informant-reported relationship
   characteristics). The findings support assumptions of classic and
   contemporary theories on the influence of social relationships on
   self-esteem and on the consequences of self-esteem for the relationship
   domain. In sum, the findings suggest that the link between people's
   social relationships and their level of self-esteem is truly reciprocal
   in all developmental stages across the life span, reflecting a positive
   feedback loop between the constructs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

The Link Between Cruelty to Animals and Violence Toward Humans

   People who hurt animals don’t stop with animals. There is an
   established link between cruelty to animals and violence toward
   humans — regularly referred to as “The Link.”

   This link makes it critically important that cruelty toward animals be
   taken seriously by law enforcement, and by society at large. This is
   for the sake of the animals themselves, and for people who are also at
   risk.

Research Shows the Link Between Cruelty to Animals and Toward Humans

   Ample research backs up the finding that there is a direct link between
   acts of cruelty to animals and violence toward humans. This includes
   child abuse, domestic violence, elder abuse and other violent behavior.

   Here are just a handful of examples of the research supporting that
   conclusion:

   A landmark 1997 study by the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention
   of Cruelty to Animals and Northeastern University found that animal
   abusers are in fact five times as likely to also harm other humans.

The Link Factsheet

   violence toward humans.

   Another study, published in 2013, found that 43% of those who commit
   school massacres also committed acts of cruelty to animals — generally
   against cats and dogs.

   Phil Arkow, coordinator of the National Link Coalition — a group
   focusing on the intersection between violence toward animals and humans
   — has written often about animal abuse being an indication of domestic
   violence, or what’s called a “predictor crime.”

   Indeed, a 1983 study notes that animal abuse was found in 88% of homes
   in which physical child abuse was being investigated.

   If a child is cruel to animals, research shows it may be a sign that
   serious abuse or neglect has been inflicted on the child. Children who
   witness animal abuse are at greater risk of becoming abusers
   themselves.

   A 2017 study showed that 89% of women who had companion animals during
   an abusive relationship reported that their animals were threatened,
   harmed, or killed by their abusive partner.

   This finding is in line with other research showing that domestic
   violence toward pets both correlates with domestic violence toward
   humans, and is also a tool of domestic abuse — violent members of the
   household will threaten to hurt or actually hurt a companion animal as
   a method of control and a form of emotional violence. Indeed, more than
   half of women in domestic violence shelters report that they delayed
   their escape out of fear for their animals.

The Law Must Protect Animals and Punish Animal Abusers

   Both because animals themselves need protection, and because of the
   link between cruelty to animals and cruelty to humans, violence against
   animals must be taken seriously under the law.

   There are some ways in which the law is reflecting this seriousness.
   For example, all 50 states now have felony animal cruelty laws on the
   books. Nearly two thirds of states allow pets to be included in
   domestic violence protective orders. These are just among the advances
   we’ve seen at the state level in this area.

   There are felony provisions in all 50 states and the District of
   Columbia for intentionally killing a dog or cat.

   At the federal level, there is progress, too. As of 2016 the FBI began
   tracking crimes against animals in the National Incident Based
   Reporting System (NIBRS), in the same way it tracks other serious
   criminal offenses. This tracking will help paint a better picture of
   who is committing crimes against animals, and where these crimes are
   taking place — and will thus also help indicate where humans are also
   at risk.

   But we are not yet at the point where cruelty to animals is
   consistently reported, investigated, prosecuted, or punished in ways
   that match the seriousness of the crime.

How to Help

   The law is only just beginning to catch up with the Americans’
   widespread view that animals are family members who need robust
   protection under the law. This is both for the sake of animal victims
   and for the safety of communities more broadly.

To 'link' or 'relate' two items?

   I'm developing a system in which users can 'link' separate items by
   using a 'Link' button. In the database, this 'link' is called a
   'relation'. I'm inclined to change the text of the button to 'Relate'
   instead of 'Link' because it seems more correct. However, I fear users
   might be confused due to popular usage of the term 'relation'.

   For example, you often see a list with 'Related terms' popping up on
   websites. When you look closely, most of the time this is a list of
   terms that might have something to do with the current term you have
   selected, but don't have an actual relation to it. I would rather call
   it 'Similar terms'.

   Might 'link' therefore be a better choice after all? Or is 'relation'
   much more correct?

     * Irrespective of what the database calls it, and notwithstanding
       that it may or may not be a "relation" in a certain sense, the end
       user's perspective is that the function of the button is to
       'establish a link' and therefore Link would be the right label for
       the button.

     * Do you mean like putting together the separate items into one
       relation (table) in your database?
       – Safira
       Jan 6, 2014 at 11:16
     * @Safira: No, they're still two separate items but you establish a
       'relationship' mainly for data integrity. So for example, when you
       delete item 1, item 2 will also be deleted. Or when you look up
       item 1, item 2 is shown as well.

     * I think, link and relate are different even in daily English. So a
       native-English user would understand even if you use link. I prefer
       link cause relate is used to put items together into a relation (a
       table), right?

   Keep link. You need a verb that can be uttered as a command.

   Verbs that are commands are best when they don't require and object.

   The meaning of link as "connect or join up" does not require an object.

   The meaning of relate as "show a connection between" can take an
   object. It doesn't always have to, but as a stand alone word relate
   makes me think of its other meaning:

     feel sympathy for or identify with

   So I would feel I was commanding the server to feel sympathy for
   whatever I've typed in.

   If you are set on using relate then I would suggest relate to be what
   you use on the button. This removes the ambiguity with the above
   definition.

     * It would be helpful if there was some explanation for the
       downvote... As for your answer, I doubt if people would feel
       they're commanding the server to feel sympathy, but I agree
       'relate' comes across as more ambiguous.
