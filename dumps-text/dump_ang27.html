       On Snapchat, “link” means you added a clickable link to your snap.
       Whether you post a pic or a video snap, you can include a link, or
       website URL, at the bottom of it. Once you’re done creating your
       snap and applying any add-ons—like stickers—that you like, tap the
       link icon on the right-hand menu. Type or paste the URL, then
       select Allow to enable it. Choose Attach to Snap at the bottom.
       Your friends and followers will see the link at the bottom of your
       snap and be able to “swipe up” on it.^[1] X Research source
          + Link to a blog, article, video, or charity to direct friends
            and followers to what’s interesting or meaningful to you.
            Anyone on Snapchat can use this feature—you can send a
            clickable link as a private snap to your friends or as a
            public story to your followers.
          + Add a caption to your snap like, “This news story is
            mind-blowing! 🤯 Check it out!”
          + Draw attention to a vid with a comment like, “Watch this clip
            of fox playing fetch! 🦊 Cute!”
          + Talk about a URL for a charity or a fundraiser with words
            like, “Let’s raise $$ for children’s hospitals! 🏥”

       On Snapchat, "link" may also mean you want to add someone as a
       friend. Maybe you want to exchange memes or secrets with a buddy,
       so you want to talk to them on Snapchat. You might’ve also met
       someone on a dating app, like Tinder or Bumble, and you’re not
       ready to give them your number yet. In this case, you’ll ask to
       “link up” on Snapchat so you can send pics and video chat.
          + “Hey, let’s link up on Snapchat! I wanna spill so much tea.
            😈☕”
          + “OMG. We should totally link up and make our own memes. 🤣 Add
            me on Snapchat!”
          + “I can’t post pics here. 😉 I think we should link up and take
            this to Snapchat”

       bond. Still, neither of you has said you’re in a relationship.

       affectionate with one another. Usually, you share juicy details
       about who you’re “linked” with in private convos over text or in
       DMs.

       Ask for a "sneaky link" if you want to meet up with someone from
       TikTok for casual sex. Based on a viral song by the same name, a
       “sneaky link” describes a “hook up” or a “one night stand.” When
       TikTok users talk about a “sneaky link,” they either want to meet
       up with each other for a quick encounter or share a story about
       some “no-strings-attached” fun they had.^[4] X Research source
          + TikTok users playfully warn you not to “fall” for your “sneaky
            link” so you can keep it light.
    2. Step 2 Keep it chill and on the down-low if you want to use TikTok
       for a "sneaky link.”

       Keep it chill and on the down-low if you want to use TikTok for a
       "sneaky link.” Since “sneaky links” are all about quick, short-term
       flings, make sure that you and your “sneaky link” partner feel
       totally okay with the situation and are fine that it’s temporary.
          + Discuss expectations and boundaries with your “sneaky link” so
            you’re on the same page.
          + Remember to practice safe sex with your “sneaky link.”
          + If you tell a story about your “sneaky link,” leave out their
            name and other personal details.
